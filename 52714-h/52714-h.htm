<h2><a name="pageiii"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
iii</span>PREFACE.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> following Sermons are committed
to the press at the request of many beloved parishioners.&nbsp;
They were originally preached, as they are now published, under a
deep sense of their imperfection, only equalled by the perfect
conviction of their truth.&nbsp; The consciousness of defect has
strongly prompted me to keep them back from public criticism; the
assurance of truth has emboldened me to hope that those who took
an interest in their delivery, may derive some profit from their
study.&nbsp; May God, the Holy Ghost, be pleased to make them
useful!&nbsp; May he accompany each copy with his blessing! and,
forgiving all defects, may He honour this little volume as an
instrument in his own hand for the perfecting of the saints, for
the work of the ministry, and for the edifying of the body of
Christ!</p>
<p>In stating the doctrines of the Church of Rome, the appeal has
been made either to the decrees or the catechism of the Council
of Trent.&nbsp; These are both authoritative documents, and form
the standards of Roman Catholic theology.&nbsp; Yet, strange to
say, some Protestants are heard to argue, that by appealing to
Trent, we misrepresent the Church of Rome.&nbsp; The decrees, it
is <a name="pageiv"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
iv</span>maintained, are antiquated documents, and no longer
express the real opinions of the church.&nbsp; The true Romanist
would not thank his advocate for such an argument.&nbsp; A change
in their fixed principles would destroy their claim to
infallibility.&nbsp; Eternal truth changes not; and whoever
changes must be wrong either before the change or after it.</p>
<p>But such a change has never taken place.&nbsp; The decrees
stand unrepealed.&nbsp; Romish priests are required to swear to
them at their ordination; Romish disputants appeal to them in
controversy; the Pope himself quotes them in his letters; and
they are to this day in full force as the standard documents of
Romanist theology.</p>
<p>Others, again, are often heard to argue that, although these
may be the principles of the Church, they are not the opinions of
individuals in union with Rome.&nbsp; It is much to be hoped that
this charitable supposition is true of multitudes; that there are
very many, who from circumstances are connected with her
communion, but who, from conviction, disclaim many of her
errors.&nbsp; But how fearful is the position of such an
enlightened Roman Catholic!&nbsp; A layman may be a member of the
Church of England, but yet differ from many of our principles,
for the only declaration of faith required as an essential to
church membership is an assent to the Apostles&rsquo;
Creed.&nbsp; This, and nothing more, is expected of every man
before he can be received into the congregation of Christ&rsquo;s
flock.&nbsp; Those who are admitted to the ministry, must add
their subscription to the Articles.&nbsp; But no subscription <a
name="pagev"></a><span class="pagenum">p. v</span>is required of
the layman; he may therefore be a faithful churchman, but yet
differ from some of the Church&rsquo;s doctrines.&nbsp; What is
impossible for the honest clergyman, is quite possible for
him.&nbsp; But such modification of sentiment is altogether
impossible with Rome.&nbsp; A layman must be either an entire
Romanist, or reject Rome altogether.&nbsp; There is no middle
course.&nbsp; A man cannot say &ldquo;I am attached to the Church
of Rome, but I do not go all lengths with her opinions.&nbsp; I
believe it to be the true church, but I disapprove of her worship
of the Virgin.&rdquo;&nbsp; For Rome has fenced in her opinions
with her curses.&nbsp; Rome is a cursing church, and the curses
attached to her decrees render modification impossible in her
laity.&nbsp; Take, e.g., the decrees respecting saint and image
worship, in the beginning of the 25th session.&nbsp; In those
decrees, it is declared that images ought to be retained in
churches, and that honour and veneration should be paid to them:
and then is added the curse, &ldquo;If any man either teach or
think contrary to these decrees, let him be
accursed.&rdquo;&nbsp; Now it is very plain, that at first sight
the word of God appears in opposition to these decrees, for, if
not, the second commandment would never have been expunged from
Romish catechisms.&nbsp; But if any conscientious Roman Catholic
happen to read the 20th chapter of the book of Exodus; if the
thought flash across his mind that the word of God may possibly
mean what it certainly appears to say; if he venture to think
that God meant to forbid image worship when he said, &ldquo;Thou
shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any likeness of
anything <a name="pagevi"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
vi</span>that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth
beneath, or that is in the water under the earth: thou shalt not
bow down thyself to them, nor serve them.&rdquo;&nbsp; For that
one passing thought his own church curses him.&nbsp; She does not
wait till the thought has found utterance in language; he may
never breathe his difficulties to his dearest friend; it is
enough if he ever dare to feel a difficulty; for that one secret
doubt the church lays upon him the burden of her anathema.&nbsp;
Modified popery is therefore an impossibility.&nbsp; If men
believe the Church of Rome to be the true church, they must
receive her whole system; they cannot pick and choose for
themselves; they cannot retain communion, and yet differ from any
of her doctrines.&nbsp; They must reject her altogether, or
deliver themselves over, bound hand and foot, mind and
conscience, judgment and will, to her decisions.&nbsp; Such are
the terms of union which Rome imposes on her people.&nbsp; They
leave no middle course between abject submission and fearless
rejection; between unconditional surrender to her decrees, and
unflinching defiance of her anathemas.</p>
<p>Let us Protestants turn those curses into prayers!&nbsp; Let
us plead with God to have compassion on our poor Roman Catholic
brethren; to burst the bands which are now rivetted on their
conscience and their judgment; and to lead them by his Spirit to
the full enjoyment of the truth as it is in Jesus!</p>

<h2><a name="page1"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 1</span>SERMON
I.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">THE SCRIPTURES.</span></h2>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">2 <span
class="smcap">Tim</span>. iii. 15.</p>
<p>And that from a child thou hast known the holy Scriptures,
which are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith
which is in Christ Jesus.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">To</span> everything there is a
season.&rdquo;&nbsp; There is &ldquo;a time to keep silence, and
a time to speak;&rdquo; a time to be still, and a time to act;
and it is the duty of the careful watchman of the Lord, to be
ever on the alert in watching the rapid progress of God&rsquo;s
providence; to be silent when it is the time for stillness; to
speak, and speak plainly, when he deems it to be the time for
utterance.&nbsp; It is a conviction of this, which has led to the
commencement of the present course of sermons.&nbsp; There has
never been a period since the days of the Reformation, in which
greater efforts have been made for the advancement of the
influence, and power, of the Church of Rome; agents have been
multiplied in every direction; the order of Jesuits has been
revived; and a zeal has been shown in all branches of their
efforts, which would reflect honour on a better <a
name="page2"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 2</span>cause.&nbsp;
But there are two facts in our present position, which deserve
our especial notice,&mdash;the one, that our own happy island is
the great object of their exertions.&nbsp; Yes, England, our own
dear England, is the prize at which Rome is aiming.&nbsp; The
other, that at the very point of this remarkable crisis in the
history of our nation, it is proposed in the parliament of this
protestant country, to give a large and permanent endowment to
the Roman Catholic college at Maynooth; that is, to strengthen
and increase the priests of a system, which is declared by our
constitution to be unscriptural and untrue.</p>
<p>Surely, then, the time is come to speak.&nbsp; Surely the
watchman is bound to sound the note of warning.&nbsp; Surely the
whole company of God&rsquo;s believing people should know well
the reason of the hope that is in them, that they may be able to
take their place with boldness in the armies of the Lord; and, in
the last great fearful struggle against Antichrist, be found
standing stedfast, amongst the fearless, faithful, followers of
the Lamb.</p>
<p>It is my intention, therefore, to preach a short course of
sermons on some of the leading principles of our protestant
church.&nbsp; It will be my endeavour rather to set forth the
truth than to occupy your time in exposing error.&nbsp;
God&rsquo;s people come here to be fed with the bread of life,
and they must not be robbed of their daily food by the
introduction of cold and cheerless controversy.&nbsp; Our
constant desire and prayer to God for you all is, not that you
should be subtle controversialists, but well instructed and
practical <a name="page3"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
3</span>believers in your Lord.&nbsp; This great end I now hope
to keep steadily in view.</p>
<p>Pray for me, dear brethren, that my intention may be carried
into effect.&nbsp; Pray that the spirit of the living God may
himself direct me in this effort for his glory!&nbsp; Pray for
us, as we pray for you, &ldquo;that speaking the truth in love,
we may grow up unto him in all things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now the controversy between the church of England, and that of
Rome, hinges mainly upon one great turning point, namely this,
they deny the Bible to be the only rule of faith, and appeal to
other writings as a sufficient authority in their statements of
sacred truth.&nbsp; To the Bible, then, as the rule of faith, we
must direct our first attention, and will endeavour to point
out,</p>
<p>I.&nbsp; Its supreme authority.</p>
<p>II.&nbsp; Its complete sufficiency.</p>
<p>III.&nbsp; Its clear intelligibility.</p>
<p>I.&nbsp; First, then, for its supreme authority.&nbsp; There
is no occasion now to enter into proofs of its inspiration.&nbsp;
That all scripture is given by inspiration of God, we may regard
as an admitted truth: we are not dealing with the infidel, but
with those who profess to believe the Scriptures: we are to
receive it &ldquo;not as the word which man&rsquo;s wisdom
teacheth, but which the Holy Ghost teacheth:&rdquo; to listen to
it, &ldquo;as it is in truth, the word of God.&rdquo;&nbsp; All
that we are concerned with now is the supreme authority, which,
being inspired, it possesses over man.&nbsp; Our object is to
point out, that as the word of God, it has absolute authority in
all its statements of divine truth, and that just as the written
<a name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 4</span>law is the
one rule for the nation&rsquo;s government, so the written word
is the one rule of the Church&rsquo;s faith.&nbsp; Who can reveal
the truth of God but God himself?&nbsp; &ldquo;The things of God
knoweth no man, but the Spirit of God.&rdquo;&nbsp; And when God
speaks, who shall dare to give an opposing judgment?&nbsp;
&ldquo;Be silent, O all flesh, before the Lord!&rdquo;&nbsp; Let
us strive then to realize this fact, that the Bible comes direct
from &ldquo;God, who cannot lie;&rdquo; that it is his own
statement of his own divine purposes; that He has, as it were,
put his seal and signature to it, to mark it as his own; that he
has brought it forth amongst us with the solemn preface,
&ldquo;Thus saith the Lord;&rdquo; and there can then be no doubt
left as to its certain, its invariable, its unfailing, its
authoritative truth.&nbsp; There it stands, unshaken in its
supremacy: like the Sun in heaven, beyond the reach of
man&rsquo;s attack: like the great mountains, immoveable by
man&rsquo;s effort.&nbsp; &ldquo;Thy word is truth,&rdquo; saith
the Saviour, certain, unfailing, unerring truth; and though
multitudes may deny, though thousands may resist, though the
whole body of unconverted men may hate its message, it is still
truth; the pure, unmixed, unadulterated truth of God.&nbsp; Nor
can any amount of human evidence rival its authority.&nbsp;
Multiplication does not make inspiration.&nbsp; Ten thousand
butterflies do not make an eagle; nor can the human intellect,
however multiplied, be measured for a moment with the mind of
God.&nbsp; Thus, if it were to fall out, (which thanks be to his
grace it never can), that all living men, of all ages and all
ranks, were to agree in the denial of any one doctrine of the <a
name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 5</span>gospel; if all
the great, all the learned, all philosophers, and all divines;
all that now live, or ever have lived, were to concur in one
united opinion, and that opinion were in opposition to the Bible;
then all must be wrong, and the Bible must be right; for they are
men, and the Holy Ghost is God; and &ldquo;Let God be true, and
every man a liar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now, we fully admit that the Church of Rome does not openly
deny the supreme authority of Scripture, but it virtually sets it
aside by two principles: the one, that it is not complete; the
other, that it cannot be understood without the interpretation of
the Church.&nbsp; We must examine, therefore,</p>
<p>II.&nbsp; Its complete sufficiency.</p>
<p>The idea taught by the Church of Rome is, that there are two
channels of divine truth, two streams conveying the same water,
the written, and the unwritten word, the written found in the
Bible, the unwritten, in the traditions and decrees of the
Church. <a name="citation5"></a><a href="#footnote5"
class="citation">[5]</a>&nbsp; Thus by attempting to blend the
two, they throw the Bible virtually into the shade; and like the
Jews of old, &ldquo;make void the commandment of God by their
traditions.&rdquo;&nbsp; The opposing principle of the Church of
England, is, that the written word is itself sufficient; that <a
name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 6</span>it contains an
ample and complete statement of the whole truth of God.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Holy Scripture containeth all things necessary to
Salvation: so that whatsoever is not read therein, nor may be
proved thereby, is not to be required of any man, that it should
be believed as an Article of the Faith, or be thought requisite
or necessary to salvation.&nbsp; In the name of the Holy
Scripture we do understand those canonical books of the Old and
New Testament, of whose authority was never any doubt in the
Church.&rdquo; <a name="citation6"></a><a href="#footnote6"
class="citation">[6]</a></p>
<p>1.&nbsp; And is not this evident from the <i>direct
statements</i> of the word of God itself?</p>
<p>Look only at the passage from which our text is taken, v.
15.&nbsp; The Holy Scriptures &ldquo;are able to make thee wise
unto salvation through faith which is in Christ
Jesus.&rdquo;&nbsp; They are sufficient, then, for the heavenly
wisdom of the people of God; nothing more is needed; they contain
God&rsquo;s truth, and make men wise in his wisdom.&nbsp; But
this is not all: follow on the passage: &ldquo;All Scripture is
given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for
reproof, for correction, for instruction in
righteousness.&rdquo;&nbsp; And what is the result?&nbsp;
&ldquo;That the man of God may be perfect, throughly furnished
unto all good works.&rdquo;&nbsp; Who shall presume to say, then,
that the written word is not sufficient?&nbsp; There is enough in
it to form a perfect character, to leave nothing wanting in the
furniture of the religious mind.&nbsp; When it says, &ldquo;They
are able to make thee wise unto salvation,&rdquo; it teaches that
they reveal all that can be needful to make Christ&rsquo;s coming
kingdom <a name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
7</span>ours: when it adds, &ldquo;That the man of God may be
perfect, throughly furnished unto all good works;&rdquo; it
proves that they also supply us with the sum total of all that
can be needed in our pilgrimage through life.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; But, even, if we had no such direct statement, we
have ample proof of the completeness of the Bible in the simple
fact, that there is <i>nothing else inspired</i>.&nbsp; If there
be a void left, it must remain unfilled for ever.&nbsp; If there
be a chasm, the whole world can never close it.&nbsp; For if
there were deficiencies in the Bible, to whom should we go to
supply the defect?&nbsp; To the Fathers?&nbsp; They were holy,
devoted, fervent men, and multitudes amongst their number counted
not their life dear unto them, if only they might fulfil the
ministry, which they received of the Lord.&nbsp; But they were
men after all, fallible, and often failing men; they never
pretended to inspiration; they knew far too much both of
themselves and God to presume to say of their own writings,
&ldquo;Thus saith the Lord.&rdquo;&nbsp; They never claimed
either inspiration or infallibility.&nbsp; To whom then shall we
go?&nbsp; To councils?&nbsp; But they were human too, they were
assemblies of fallible men, so fallible, that in one instance the
whole church was actually induced to decide against the divinity
of our blessed Lord.&nbsp; This was the case, when the whole body
of the Church, bishops, priests, deacons, and laymen, were all
arrayed against Athanasius, and Athanasius alone stood forth as
the champion for truth.&nbsp; Athanasius was against the world
and the world against Athanasius.&nbsp; To whom then shall we
go?&nbsp; To the Pope?&nbsp; But he too is a man, and as too <a
name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 8</span>many sad facts
in the history of popedom prove, a fallible and often failing
man.&nbsp; To whom then shall we go?&nbsp; Shall we seek for some
united testimony of fathers, councils, and popes?&nbsp; It would
be a hopeless task, it would be to attempt an impossibility, for
they are perpetually differing, and when we had gained it, we
should after all have only the testimony of man.&nbsp; To whom
then shall we go?&nbsp; Peter must give the answer, &ldquo;Thou
hast the words of eternal life.&rdquo;&nbsp; We will not now stop
to discuss the question whether it be possible for men to fill up
the deficiencies of the word of God.&nbsp; He that cannot add a
single inch to his own stature, he surely can add nothing to the
volume of inspired truth.&nbsp; He that cannot add one single
leaf to the flower, nor give one additional wing to the insect,
he surely can contribute nothing to the most perfect of all the
works of God, the revelation of his own hidden will.&nbsp; It was
prophesied originally of the Roman Empire, that it should be part
of iron, part of clay; a fit image of that false system, which
would blend together in one whole, the word of God, and the word
of man.&nbsp; As well might you expect to strengthen iron by the
mixture of a little fragile clay: as well might you hold up the
candle in the vain endeavour to add to the brightness of the
noon-day sun: as well might you strive to perfect the beauty of
the clear fountain of water of life, clear as crystal, proceeding
from the throne of God and of the Lamb, by adding to it waters
that have been stained and thickened in their passage along an
earthly world, as hope to add anything to the word of God, by
mixing up with it the word of man.</p>
<p><a name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 9</span>The fact,
then, that there is nothing else inspired, is in itself a proof
that the Bible is complete.&nbsp; Either the Bible is sufficient,
or we are left without a sufficient guide.&nbsp; We may,
therefore, rest satisfied as to the complete sufficiency, as well
as the supreme authority of the word of God.&nbsp; But there yet
remains another subject of scarcely less importance, which we
cannot leave unnoticed.&nbsp; Namely,</p>
<p>III.&nbsp; Its clear intelligibility.</p>
<p>It is not enough, that the Scriptures are sufficient and
complete.&nbsp; For practical purposes they must be within the
reach of common men.</p>
<p>Now the Church of Rome takes the Bible out of the hands of
private Christians.&nbsp; They acknowledge the authority of
Scripture, but add that the church alone has the power to
interpret it: they say there are many difficulties, and that it
requires the church&rsquo;s interpretation to unravel the path of
life. <a name="citation9"></a><a href="#footnote9"
class="citation">[9]</a>&nbsp; This principle places the people
in absolute dependence on those who call themselves the
church.&nbsp; It draws their attention to the church rather than
to God.&nbsp; It teaches them to rely on man&rsquo;s comment, and
to lose sight of God&rsquo;s decree.&nbsp; When looking through a
painted window, your eye is fixed on the glass, and loses sight
of the sun behind, which lightens it; so when we look at truth
through the medium <a name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
10</span>of human interpretation, the sight is caught by the
human colouring, and the light of God&rsquo;s eternal truth is
thrown into obscurity with the neglected word.&nbsp; Now true
Protestants gain their light, not through the coloured glass, but
from heaven itself, that is, they look to the word of God, and
not to man&rsquo;s interpretation as the decision of christian
truth.</p>
<p>At the same time we must not deny that there are difficulties
in the Scriptures.&nbsp; Its subject is infinity, its range
eternity, its author God; and it would be folly to suppose that
poor, frail, shortsighted, and shortlived man, should be able at
a glance to measure the unfathomable depths of God&rsquo;s
unexplored wisdom.</p>
<p>Nor are we to underrate the high importance of the sacred
ministry.&nbsp; It was the gift of our blessed Lord after his
ascension. <a name="citation10a"></a><a href="#footnote10a"
class="citation">[10a]</a>&nbsp; It is carried on under the
appointment and arrangement of the Holy Ghost. <a
name="citation10b"></a><a href="#footnote10b"
class="citation">[10b]</a>&nbsp; When Israel was without &ldquo;a
teaching priest,&rdquo; they were &ldquo;without the true
God,&rdquo; and &ldquo;without the law.&rdquo; <a
name="citation10c"></a><a href="#footnote10c"
class="citation">[10c]</a>&nbsp; When men labour for Christ,
&ldquo;rightly dividing the word of truth,&rdquo; they are the
great instruments in the hand of God for the ingathering of his
elect, and the preservation of his children for eternal
glory.&nbsp; We admit then freely and fully, 1st, the existence
of difficulties in Scripture, and 2ndly, the importance and
extreme value of a living and expounding ministry.&nbsp; At the
same time, we are no less prepared to assert with the <a
name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 11</span>utmost
earnestness, that the people of God are bound by, or dependent
on, no interpretation of any man whatever.&nbsp; God has spoken
in his word, and God has spoken plainly.&nbsp; Let us examine two
or three of the many proofs.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; See the <i>use made of Scripture in the time of
inspiration</i>.&nbsp; Look at the well known case of the
Bereans, Acts xvii. 11: they brought Paul himself to the test of
Scripture; a set of laymen went daily to their Bibles to see if
the man of God himself were true, and for this, which would be
mortal sin in the Church of Rome, they were actually commended by
the Holy Ghost, for a &ldquo;These were more noble than those in
Thessalonica, in that they received the word with all readiness
of mind, and searched the Scriptures daily to see if these things
were so.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Berean laymen, therefore, were right,
when they studied their Bible as the rule of faith.&nbsp; Take
again the case of Timothy.&nbsp; Timothy, we know, was a
remarkable man.&nbsp; St. Paul loved him as his own child, and
always spoke of him as his son.&nbsp; He was to Paul what John
was to Christ.&nbsp; The grace in his heart was of early growth;
he was one of those chosen few, who were believers from their
youth.&nbsp; But mark his early history.&nbsp; He lived at
Lystra, a heathen city: his father was a heathen, yet Timothy
knew his Bible well: he had learned it of his mother, as she too
from hers.&nbsp; Here then we have a little band of Bible
students in the midst of a heathen city: it consisted of two
women and one little boy.&nbsp; And yet we are to be told that
the bible does not speak plainly to common people, that it cannot
<a name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 12</span>be
understood until the church interpret.&nbsp; Who interpreted to
Timothy?&nbsp; Who to Eunice?&nbsp; Who to Lois?</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Or refer to the <i>purpose for which the book was
written</i>.&nbsp; The Lord said to Habakkuk, <a
name="citation12a"></a><a href="#footnote12a"
class="citation">[12a]</a> &ldquo;Write the vision, and make it
plain upon tables, that he may run that readeth it.&rdquo;&nbsp;
It was his intention, therefore, that the prophecy should be
understood.&nbsp; Of the whole Old Testament, St. Paul says,
&ldquo;Whatsoever things were written aforetime, were written for
our learning, that we&rdquo; (i.e. believers generally)
&ldquo;might have hope.&rdquo; Rom. xv. 4.&nbsp; They were
intended therefore for the learning and comfort of the
church.&nbsp; St. John&rsquo;s gospel was written &ldquo;that ye
might believe that Jesus is the Christ the Son of God, and that
believing ye might have life through his name.&rdquo; John xx.
31.&nbsp; And his epistle was addressed to those that believe on
the Son of God; &ldquo;that ye might know that ye have eternal
life, and that ye might believe on the name of the Son of
God,&rdquo; John v. 13.&nbsp; What can be plainer than that God
designed the Bible for the church at large, for the comfort and
instruction of the whole body of his believing people?</p>
<p>And now add to this the declared purpose for which the Holy
Ghost dwells amongst men.&nbsp; He is &ldquo;the Spirit of
truth,&rdquo; <a name="citation12b"></a><a href="#footnote12b"
class="citation">[12b]</a> &ldquo;to guide us into all
truth,&rdquo; &ldquo;the Spirit of wisdom and revelation in the
knowledge of Christ.&rdquo; <a name="citation12c"></a><a
href="#footnote12c" class="citation">[12c]</a>&nbsp; And of Him
St. John writes: &ldquo;The anointing which ye have received of
him abideth in you, and ye need not that any man teach you: but
as the same <a name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
13</span>anointing teacheth you of all things, and is truth and
is no lie, and even as it hath taught you, ye shall abide in
him.&rdquo; <a name="citation13a"></a><a href="#footnote13a"
class="citation">[13a]</a>&nbsp; Can any one read such passages
and doubt for a moment that it is the purpose of the Holy Ghost
to teach God&rsquo;s people by throwing light upon the pages of
his inspired word? and would not that man set himself up above
the God of heaven, who would dare to pronounce it inexpedient to
give the Bible to every living soul within the church?</p>
<p>And now observe the following pastoral letter from the Romish
bishops and archbishops in Ireland.&nbsp; Having received a
letter from Pope Leo the 12th, dated May 1824, addressed to all
Patriarchs, Primates, Archbishops, and Bishops, and they conveyed
the substance of it to the Irish priests in the following
words.&nbsp; &ldquo;Our holy Father recommends to the observance
of the faithful, a rule of the congregation of the Index, which
prohibits the perusal of the Sacred scriptures in the vulgar
tongue, without the sanction of the competent authorities.&nbsp;
His holiness wisely remarks that more evil than good is found to
result from the indiscriminate perusal of them on account of the
malice or infirmity of men. <a name="citation13b"></a><a
href="#footnote13b" class="citation">[13b]</a>&nbsp; In this
sentiment of our head and chief we fully concur.&rdquo;&nbsp; So
they do not hesitate boldly to declare, that the <a
name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 14</span>very words
which the Holy Ghost inspired for our learning are productive of
more harm than good.&nbsp; It is true that they ascribe the
failure to the malice or infirmity of men: but did not God know
what men were when he gave the Scriptures?&nbsp; Did he suppose
men better than they are? or has the Pope a greater insight into
human nature than God himself?&nbsp; The use of such language
implies either that God was ignorant of man&rsquo;s nature, or
knowing it, was unsuccessful in addressing it; in other words it
amounts to the bold blasphemy of ascribing either ignorance or
impotence to God.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; But again, look at the <i>practical experience</i> <a
name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 15</span>of daily
life.&nbsp; We appeal to every Bible reading Christian, does not
the word of God speak plainly? 1 know there are some to whom it
may appear a sealed book, but God always opens it as they advance
in their study.&nbsp; There are many flowers, which in the early
morn, seem to possess little interest or beauty, for their bloom
is closed; but when the sun gets up, and they feel its genial
heat, the leaf expands, and the blossom opens, sweet in its
fragrance, and lovely in its colouring and form.&nbsp; So it is
with the Scriptures.&nbsp; The unopened Bible may seem dull and
powerless to the beginner, but let the Holy Ghost beam his light
upon its sacred pages, and it becomes more beautiful than the
lily, more fragrant than the rose of Sharon.&nbsp; Did ever
hungry soul go to the word, and not find in it the clear
description of the bread of life?&nbsp; Is there any confusion in
its language, when it addresses the broken-hearted penitent, and
assures him, saying, &ldquo;The blood of Jesus Christ the son
cleanseth us from all sin?&rdquo;&nbsp; Is there any
indistinctness in that gentle whisper with which God, as a tender
husband, sooths the sorrowing widow, and leading her into a
solitary place, there speaks to her heart, saying,
&ldquo;Comfort, comfort ye my people?&rdquo;&nbsp; Is there any
want of lucid clearness in the lovely portraiture of our blessed
Lord?&nbsp; Is it possible to mistake his holy character?&nbsp;
Is there any lack of shrill distinctness in the sound of the
warning trumpet, in the prophecies of coming judgment, in the
curse passed on sin, in the promises of glory?&nbsp; Nay,
beloved! man may tell us that the traveller cannot see to track
his path, when the summer sun <a name="page16"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 16</span>shines in its strength: man may tell
us that there is no refreshment in the cool stream that gurgles
up clear as crystal from beneath the shady rock: and we would
believe them, even then, sooner than we would believe the Church
of Rome, when she tells us, that the way of life is not pointed
out plainly, in the word which God has written, to guide and
cheer his people heavenwards.</p>
<p>We have found, then, that the Bible is of supreme authority,
complete sufficiency, and clear intelligibility.&nbsp; And now,
dear brethren, what a deep sympathy should we feel for the laity
of the Church of Rome!&nbsp; One fact may illustrate their
position.&nbsp; When two members of the deputation of the Church
of Scotland to the Jews arrived at Brody, on the borders of
Austrian Poland, every book was taken from them, even their
Hebrew and English Bibles.&nbsp; Being sealed up they were sent
on to Cracow, and delivered to them when they quitted the
Austrian dominions.&nbsp; On pleading for their English Bible,
the only answer was, &ldquo;It is not allowed in
Austria.&rdquo;&nbsp; Thus are the bulk of the people kept at a
distance from that clear and lucid stream.&nbsp; The church, like
the painted window, stands between them and the pure light of
heaven.&nbsp; Who can wonder, then, that there are errors and
superstitions?&nbsp; Who can be surprised to see them bend before
the Virgin, when they are thus kept back from Christ?&nbsp; We
should not despise them, but pity them: we should weep for them,
as our lord wept over Jerusalem: we should pray for them, as he
prayed upon the cross, &ldquo;Father forgive them, for <a
name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 17</span>they know not
what they do.&rdquo;&nbsp; None can doubt that multitudes are
truly desiring to walk with God; truly in earnest in their rounds
of prayers and penance.&nbsp; You may oftentimes see them on the
Continent sobbing and pleading in unremitting and earnest prayer,
but alas! it is too often before the Virgin&rsquo;s
picture.&nbsp; They know no better, they are kept from the word
of life, and in many cases they sink to their grave, ignorant of
the very existence of the Bible.</p>
<p>And there is a lesson here for ourselves too, dear
brethren.&nbsp; We must remember that it is not enough to belong
to a church which puts the Bible into our hands, or to listen to
a ministry which appeals to it as the rule of faith.&nbsp; We
must make it our own; we must take it to ourselves as our
birth-right.&nbsp; It is not enough that we possess the printed
book, it must be also written on the understanding by careful,
diligent, persevering study; and on the heart by the pen of the
Holy Ghost himself.&nbsp; He is but a poor Protestant that
neglects his Bible.&nbsp; Nay, more, he is but a poor Christian,
for he that knows little of his Bible can scarcely fail to know
still less of God.&nbsp; Let us, then, be stedfast Bible
Christians, devoted Bible students.&nbsp; Let us determine that,
God giving us grace, we will know Christ as our God reveals him,
know him as our own Redeemer, as our own Advocate, as our own
Lord and King, and let us never rest content till we can say with
the prophet &ldquo;Thy word was found and I did eat it: and thy
word was unto me the joy and rejoicing of my heart.&rdquo;</p>
<h2><a name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 18</span>SERMON
II.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">JUSTIFICATION.</span></h2>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center"><span
class="smcap">Acts</span> xiii. 39.</p>
<p>And by him all that believe are justified from all things,
from which ye could not be justified by the law of Moses.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">If</span> my object in the present course
of sermons had been simply to produce a popular impression
against the church of Rome, I doubt whether I should have
selected the doctrine of justification as the subject for our
thought this evening.&nbsp; The error, though quite as deadly, is
not so glaring as in other portions of their system.&nbsp; But,
as I said on Sunday last, my great design is to confirm you in
the saving truths of Christ&rsquo;s gospel, &ldquo;that speaking
the truth in love, we may grow up unto him in all
things.&rdquo;&nbsp; To this end there is no subject more
important than the present; it touches our very life; it concerns
our present peace and eternal joy; it involves the question,
whether the door is closed or opened, by which the sinner can
find access to God.&nbsp; Let us endeavour then to approach it
with the seriousness due to so great a matter, and let us all
lift up our hearts to the Father of lights, the giver of every
good and <a name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
19</span>perfect gift, that the Holy Ghost may be shed on us
abundantly through Jesus Christ our Lord!</p>
<p>The point at issue between the Church of Rome and Church of
England does not relate to the justification of the heathen man,
when he first approaches Christ in baptism.&nbsp; This they term
the first justification, and acknowledge with us that it is
through faith.&nbsp; It is with reference to what is usually
called the second justification that the great difference exists
between us.&nbsp; This is the justification of baptized
Christians, of persons like ourselves, who have sinned after
baptism; and the question is, What is the instrument by which
justification is applied to us?</p>
<p>The doctrine of our Protestant church is clearly laid down in
the 11th Article, &ldquo;We are accounted righteous before God
only for the merit of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ by faith,
and not for our works, or deservings: Wherefore, that we are
justified by faith only is a most wholesome doctrine, and very
full of comfort, as more largely is expressed in the Homily of
Justification.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The doctrine of the church of Rome is that there is
righteousness infused into the mind, as warmth into the heated
iron, and that we are justified by the merit of this infused or
inherent righteousness; or, in other words, that our own good
thoughts, good works, alms, prayers, fastings, &amp;c. so satisfy
God&rsquo;s law, that in consequence of them we may claim eternal
life as our own well deserved reward.&nbsp; The council of Trent
has decreed as follows:&mdash;&ldquo;If any man shall <a
name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 20</span>say, that men
are justified either by the sole imputation of the righteousness
of Christ, or the sole remission of our sins, and not by grace
and charity, which is diffused in their hearts by the Holy
Spirit, and is inherent in them, let him be accursed.&rdquo; <a
name="citation19"></a><a href="#footnote19"
class="citation">[19]</a></p>
<p>In other words the Church of England teaches that we are
accepted before God through the righteousness of our blessed
Lord, imputed freely to all that believe; the Church of Rome,
that we are accepted before God through the righteousness wrought
in us, and the merit of our own acts and doings.&nbsp; The Church
of England that we are justified by faith; the Church of Rome
that we are justified by works.</p>
<p>To those who know their Bibles, there can be little difficulty
in the decision of this important question.&nbsp; That we are
justified by faith stands forth as plainly as the summer sun in
heaven.</p>
<p>Acts xiii. 39.&nbsp; &ldquo;And by him all that believe are
justified from all things, from which ye could not be justified
by the law of Moses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Romans iii. 24.&nbsp; &ldquo;Being justified freely by his
grace, through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus.&rdquo;</p>
<p>26.&nbsp; &ldquo;To declare, I say, at this time, his
righteousness: that he might be just and the justifier of him
which believeth in Jesus.&rdquo;</p>
<p>28.&nbsp; &ldquo;Therefore we conclude that a man is justified
by faith without the deeds of the law.&rdquo;</p>
<p>iv. 2, 3.&nbsp; &ldquo;For if Abraham were justified by works,
he hath whereof to glory; but not before <a
name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 21</span>God.&nbsp;
For what saith the scripture?&nbsp; Abraham believed God, and it
was counted to him for righteousness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gal. ii. 16.&nbsp; &ldquo;Knowing that a man is not justified
by the works of the law, but by the faith of Jesus Christ, even
we have believed in Jesus Christ, that we might be justified by
the faith of Christ, and not by the works of the law: for by the
works of the law shall no flesh be justified.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here we might well leave the subject, but as this was the
great battle-field of the Reformation, it may be well to examine
rather more carefully into the question.&nbsp; In doing this we
will endeavour to show&mdash;</p>
<p>I.&nbsp; That all justifying righteousness must be
perfect.</p>
<p>II.&nbsp; That inherent righteousness can never justify even
the regenerate.</p>
<p>III.&nbsp; That the imputed righteousness of Christ is of
itself perfect and sufficient.</p>
<p>I.&nbsp; All justifying righteousness must be perfect; for
justification is a legal act, and justifying righteousness is
that which satisfies the law.&nbsp; The law, or will of God, lays
down a certain rule of life and conduct, as the law of a country
lays down certain regulations for the citizen.&nbsp; As the
sovereign for his subjects, so God appoints his law for
man.&nbsp; Now if the law be satisfied by man, then man is
justified by the law.&nbsp; The law lays nothing to his charge;
he is really free, and he is accounted free; he is fully and
completely justified by his perfect fulfilment of the will of
God.&nbsp; Such a character would stand before God in the same
position as we do before the earthly judge.&nbsp; We are
justified by our country&rsquo;s laws; <a name="page22"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 22</span>we enjoy our liberty, and walk
through the length and breadth of our happy land, free as the
winds of heaven, in our own right, and, as far as human law is
concerned, our own righteousness.&nbsp; We have not broken our
country&rsquo;s laws, so we can stand up boldly before our
country&rsquo;s judge.&nbsp; Now, with reference to our country,
or to the law of man, this innocence is a justifying
righteousness.&nbsp; It secures to us a perfect freedom, it
strips the law of all claim either on liberty or life.&nbsp; If
there were a similar obedience to the law of God, that obedience
would be a justifying righteousness before God.&nbsp; If the law
were satisfied, the creature would be justified; the satisfied
law would itself declare him free.&nbsp; The law would be
disarmed of all power of threat, curse, or punishment; the
righteous man would stand boldly before the judgment, and say,
&ldquo;I have fulfilled the law, and I now demand the
crown.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now there is one thing self-evident respecting this justifying
righteousness; namely this, It must be perfect, or it all falls
to the ground.&nbsp; If one stone be removed from the
self-supporting arch, the whole fabric falls into ruin.&nbsp; One
leak is enough to sink the noblest ship in England&rsquo;s
navy.&nbsp; So by the laws of our country, if there be one breach
of one law, our liberty is lost, our right is gone, our
justifying righteousness is no more.&nbsp; If there be one single
act of transgression, one single violation of one single statute,
the law is broken, and the offender is subject to its
punishment.&nbsp; How many a poor culprit has lost his life for
one solitary act!&nbsp; As with the law of England, so it is with
the law of God.&nbsp; The righteousness that can justify must be
a perfect <a name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
23</span>righteousness.&nbsp; If there be one act of
disobedience, the offender becomes a sinner, and must plead for
mercy, if he would hope to shun the curse.&nbsp; His right and
righteousness are gone together; he must cease for ever to urge
any claim on glory.&nbsp; St. James states this plainly, <a
name="citation23a"></a><a href="#footnote23a"
class="citation">[23a]</a> &ldquo;For whosoever shall keep the
whole law, and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of
all.&nbsp; For he that said, Do not commit adultery, said also,
Do not kill.&nbsp; Now if thou commit no adultery, yet if thou
kill, thou art become a transgressor of the law:&rdquo; and St.
Paul confirms it, when he quotes the words, <a
name="citation23b"></a><a href="#footnote23b"
class="citation">[23b]</a> &ldquo;Cursed is every one that
continueth not in <i>all</i> things that are written in the book
of the law to do them.&rdquo;&nbsp; He does not say <i>some</i>
things, or <i>most</i> things, or a <i>great many</i> things, but
<i>all</i> things.</p>
<p>And this may point out the distinction between the
righteousness which can justify, and the righteousness which may
please.&nbsp; That which can justify must be perfect, for it must
leave the law unbroken before the judge; that which can please
may be defective, for it may be little more than the first
risings of a filial love, than the first efforts to do the will
of a loving Father.&nbsp; The prodigal pleased his father, when
he first turned his thoughts towards his long forsaken home, but
none would argue that he was then justified by his
obedience.&nbsp; Mary pleased her Saviour, when she sat at his
feet, and drank in his sacred teaching, but that one act could
not justify her soul before the judgment-seat of God.&nbsp; David
did well that it was in his heart to build the temple, but he
could not appeal to that one secret, unfulfilled <a
name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 24</span>intention, as
a justifying righteousness, which could clear his soul, or fulfil
the law.&nbsp; To sing the song of thankful praise pleaseth the
Lord &ldquo;better than a bullock that hath horns and
hoofs,&rdquo; but though we sang that song throughout eternity,
it would prove nothing before the judgment-seat, it could never
constitute such a righteousness that the judge could say
&ldquo;Well done, you have fulfilled the law.&rdquo; <a
name="citation24"></a><a href="#footnote24"
class="citation">[24]</a></p>
<p>If we bear in mind this distinction, we shall easily establish
our second point, namely,</p>
<p>II.&nbsp; That inherent righteousness can never justify even
the regenerate: and for this one simple reason, that the
righteousness of the very best is altogether imperfect before
God.</p>
<p>We all know what a vast change is wrought in a man when he is
born again of the Holy Ghost, a change sometimes compared to a
resurrection, sometimes to a new creation, and always ascribed to
the arm of God&rsquo;s omnipotent sovereignty.&nbsp; In this
change the heart of stone is taken away, and the heart of flesh
is granted; the eagle is transformed into the dove; the lion
becomes the lamb; the wild bramble is changed into the fruitful
vine; the barren waste rejoices and blossoms like the rose.&nbsp;
Let us none lower the character of this vast and most lovely
change.&nbsp; It is more beautiful than that of the chrysalis to
the butterfly; more wonderful than that of the buried <a
name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 25</span>corpse to the
living man; more gladdening, than when the vast world sprang out
of nothing at the command of God.&nbsp; There are only two
occasions mentioned in the Bible, in which the company before the
throne are described as finding increase to their already perfect
joy; the one was the creation, when &ldquo;all the sons of God
shouted for joy:&rdquo;<a name="citation25a"></a><a
href="#footnote25a" class="citation">[25a]</a>&mdash;the other,
the gathering in of the new born penitent, for &ldquo;there is
joy in heaven over one sinner that repenteth.&rdquo; <a
name="citation25b"></a><a href="#footnote25b"
class="citation">[25b]</a></p>
<p>But yet the righteousness thus implanted cannot justify, for
just look at</p>
<p>(1)&nbsp; <i>The works produced</i>.</p>
<p>There is a constant activity to be seen amongst the people of
God; they delight to do his will; they labour, and labour
diligently, to relieve distress, to comfort sorrow, to spread the
glad tidings of the kingdom of our Lord.&nbsp; Such works are the
fruits of the Spirit, and they are gladdening both to God and
man.&nbsp; To witness them in the flock is the highest joy of the
Christian minister, and never do we know such true pleasure, as
when we see you, dear brethren, thus striving to labour
stedfastly for Christ.&nbsp; Ay! and they are the joy of one
higher far than we.&nbsp; They are the fruits of the Spirit, the
delight of Christ himself, the sacrifice well pleasing,
acceptable unto God.&nbsp; St. Paul desires such results as
these, when he prays, <a name="citation25c"></a><a
href="#footnote25c" class="citation">[25c]</a> &ldquo;That ye
might walk worthy of the Lord unto all pleasing, being fruitful
in every good work, and increasing in the knowledge of
God.&rdquo;&nbsp; And Christ himself has put his <a
name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 26</span>seal and
stamp upon them, saying, <a name="citation26a"></a><a
href="#footnote26a" class="citation">[26a]</a> &ldquo;Herein is
my Father glorified, that ye bear much fruit; so shall ye be my
disciples.&rdquo;&nbsp; But how vain it is to suppose that they
can justify! they may please the Father, but they cannot satisfy
the law.&nbsp; They may seem fair before men, but who is bold
enough to pronounce them perfect before God?&nbsp; For remember
that motives must be considered as well as acts.&nbsp; See how
St. Paul argues this, 1st Cor. xiii. 3, &ldquo;And though I
bestow all my goods to feed the poor, and though I give my body
to be burned, and have not charity, it profiteth me
nothing.&rdquo;&nbsp; What could be a nobler thing than
martyrdom?&nbsp; What liberality equal to the consecration of all
his goods to feed the poor?&nbsp; Yet if there be one secret,
hidden defect of motive perceived by God alone, the Apostle
becomes nothing, &ldquo;it profiteth me nothing.&rdquo; <a
name="citation26b"></a><a href="#footnote26b"
class="citation">[26b]</a>&nbsp; &ldquo;Cut off then those things
wherein we have regarded our own glory, those things which men do
to please men, and to satisfy our own likings, those things we do
for any by respect, not sincerely and purely for the love of God,
and a small score will serve for the number of our righteous
deeds.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is with them as with the drop of
water.&nbsp; To the naked eye it seems clear and sparkling, but
when you see it under the searching light of the solar
microscope, you find it full of all uncleanness.&nbsp; So it is
with the best of human actions.&nbsp; To the naked eye they may
appear pure and even brilliant, but let the light of divine truth
beam on their inward character and motive, and there is so much
defect, so much defilement, that we are filled with wonder, not
because they fail to justify, <a name="page27"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 27</span>but because God is so gracious as to
condescend to say they please.&nbsp; Yea, verily! if the whole
church of Christ were to select from all its multitudes the very
holiest of all living men, and if that holiest of men were to
select the holiest action that he ever wrought in the holiest
period of his most holy life, that one act when referred to the
heart searching, motive judging, law of God, would be found so
tainted with defiling sin, that if his justification were to
depend on its righteousness alone, he must abandon for ever all
hope of life with God.&nbsp; &ldquo;There is none that doeth
good, no not one.&rdquo; <a name="citation27"></a><a
href="#footnote27" class="citation">[27]</a></p>
<p>(2)&nbsp; We have here referred to outward actions, let us now
trace the stream up to its source, and look at the inward state
of heart, or as it is sometimes called &ldquo;habitual
righteousness.&rdquo;&nbsp; Can this justify?&nbsp; We all know
what an inward change is wrought by the Holy Ghost in those who
are truly born of God.&nbsp; Their whole heart and mind and will
are changed.&nbsp; They love that they once despised, they long
for that which they once scorned, they walk with Jesus, whereas
before they were the slaves of sin.&nbsp; To recur to the simile
employed before, as heat is diffused through iron, so a new love,
a new righteousness is spread through the soul.&nbsp; But yet it
cannot justify, for it is not perfect.&nbsp; It is sufficient to
please, but it is defective still.&nbsp; There may be great heat
spread through the iron, while still the metal retains its
substance.&nbsp; The ice may be melted, and the water retain the
winter&rsquo;s chill.&nbsp; Just so it is with the righteousness
planted in us by the Holy Ghost.&nbsp; <a name="page28"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 28</span>There is a new warmth, but the nature
retains too much of its iron hardness: there is a melting of the
soul, but the winter&rsquo;s chill is still found in the melted
spirit.&nbsp; This is the meaning of our article when it says
&ldquo;The infection of nature doth remain yea in them that are
regenerate,&rdquo; and this remaining corruption destroys at once
all hope of justification through the righteousness of the
heart.&nbsp; Take one or two examples from the Scriptures.&nbsp;
There can be no doubt of the inward righteousness of David.&nbsp;
He was &ldquo;the sweet psalmist of Israel,&rdquo; &ldquo;the man
after God&rsquo;s own heart.&rdquo;&nbsp; If the Holy Ghost ever
gave the new life to any man it was to David.&nbsp; But was
David&rsquo;s inward righteousness such that he was
justified?&nbsp; Listen to his own prayer, Ps. cxliii. 2,
&ldquo;Enter not into judgment with thy servant; for in thy sight
shall no man living be justified.&rdquo;&nbsp; There can be no
doubt of the change of heart in Peter.&nbsp; The ardour of his
noble mind was nobly consecrated to Christ.&nbsp; But was Peter
justified by his inward righteousness?&nbsp; See how it
failed.&nbsp; One wave of strong temptation broke down his faith,
and for the time chilled his love: so that on one evening even
Peter was thrice guilty of the denial of his Lord.&nbsp; Could
Peter then be justified by his inward love?&nbsp; There can be no
doubt of the inward righteousness of Paul.&nbsp; He was
God&rsquo;s chosen vessel to bear his name among the
Gentiles.&nbsp; His whole life bore witness to the constraining
power of the love of Jesus.&nbsp; But was he justified by that
inward love?&nbsp; Listen to his own affecting language, Rom.
vii. 22&ndash;24, &ldquo;For I delight in the law of God after
the inward <a name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
29</span>man: But I see another law in my members warring against
the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of
sin which is in my members.&nbsp; O wretched man that I am! who
shall deliver me from the body of this death?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Or refer the matter to your own personal experience.&nbsp; It
is a case that requires no farfetched arguments.&nbsp; There are
multitudes amongst you, I am well persuaded, in whom the Holy
Ghost has wrought this sanctifying change.&nbsp; It is your joy,
your delight, your chief desire to walk with God.&nbsp; And now
we would appeal to you.&nbsp; Are you walking with God so
perfectly that by that righteousness you can be justified?&nbsp;
Has there been no neglect, no languor, no forgetfulness, no sloth
in his service?&nbsp; Has the whole life been like the vigorous,
active, cheerful, service of the angels around the throne?&nbsp;
Or, to go farther: is there any one hour that you have passed
from the moment of your new birth till now, upon the perfect
holiness of which you would dare to stake your salvation
throughout eternity?&nbsp; Select the time of greatest spiritual
enjoyment, the happy season when your soul glowed most fervently
with the love of Jesus; when Heaven seemed the nearest, and God
rose before you as the loveliest of the lovely; and decide
whether you can truly say &ldquo;For that time at least I did
fully, completely, and without defect, rise to the measure of the
perfect will of God.&rdquo;&nbsp; How then can Rome declare that
we are justified by the righteousness within us?&nbsp; How can
she presume to curse those who differ from her sentence?&nbsp;
How can she say &ldquo;If any man say, that we <a
name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 30</span>are justified
by the sole imputation of Christ&rsquo;s righteousness, or by the
sole remission of our sins, and not by an inherent grace diffused
in our hearts by the Holy Ghost; let him be
anathema?&rdquo;&nbsp; Who is there either in Rome or England
that can have any hope, but in free, simple, unfettered
mercy&mdash;that can have any plea before the throne of God but
that of the poor publican, who said &ldquo;Lord be merciful to me
a sinner?&rdquo; <a name="citation30"></a><a href="#footnote30"
class="citation">[30]</a></p>
<p>And this leads us, thirdly, to remark</p>
<p>III.&nbsp; That the imputed righteousness of Christ is of
itself perfect and sufficient.&nbsp; This is plainly the truth
denied in the decree above quoted.&nbsp; Justification is there
ascribed in part to the imputation of Christ&rsquo;s
righteousness, but this alone is said to be insufficient.&nbsp;
The article of our church and this decree have evident reference
to each other.&nbsp; The article says &ldquo;We are accounted
righteous before God <i>only</i> for the merit of our Lord and
Saviour Jesus Christ.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Council of Trent &ldquo;If
any man shall say that men are justified by the <i>sole</i>
imputation of Christ&rsquo;s righteousness, <a
name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 31</span>let him be
accursed.&rdquo;&nbsp; The turning point, therefore, of the whole
question is the <i>complete</i> sufficiency of the work of
Christ.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; Consider, then, his atonement. <a
name="citation31"></a><a href="#footnote31"
class="citation">[31]</a>&nbsp; &ldquo;He died, the just for the
unjust, to bring us to God.&rdquo;&nbsp; He was our substitute,
he took our place, he endured the curse of our guilt, &ldquo;he
bare our sins in his own body on the tree.&rdquo;&nbsp; Was the
price sufficient, or was it not?&nbsp; Was the substitute
accepted, or was it not?&nbsp; Was the law satisfied, or was it
not?&nbsp; If it was, the atonement was complete, the believer
free, and no further justification through righteousness can be
required.&nbsp; If not, of this one thing I am persuaded, that
nothing we can do can supply the deficiency of the work of
Jesus.&nbsp; No tears, no toils, no fastings, penances, or alms
deeds can supply that which is lacking in the price paid for the
sinner.&nbsp; If we were to weep till the ocean overflowed with
the swelling tide of penitential tears, it would avail less than
one single drop of the most precious blood of God&rsquo;s well
beloved Son.&nbsp; If we were to lacerate the body with fastings
and self-inflicted sufferings, till the very life sunk under the
penance, it would procure no gift that is not already purchased,
it could satisfy no law that is not already satisfied by the life
of Jesus.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Consider also the imputed righteousness of
Christ.&nbsp; He made himself one of us, and became our
substitute on the cross.&nbsp; As our representative, He bore our
sins in his own body, and as our representative He is now at the
right hand of God.&nbsp; God punished our sins in Him upon the
cross.&nbsp; <a name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
32</span>God accepts us in Him as his ransomed people.&nbsp; Our
sins were placed to his account, and his righteousness to
ours.&nbsp; This explains 2 Cor. v. 21, &ldquo;For he hath made
him to be sin for us who knew no sin, that we might be made the
righteousness of God in him.&rdquo;&nbsp; He was not made really
sinful, but sin was imputed to him; he was reckoned as a sinner;
he bore the sinner&rsquo;s curse.&nbsp; But we are made the
righteousness of God in the same sense in which he was made sin;
that is, righteousness is imputed to us, we are reckoned
righteous, we are made heirs of the Redeemer&rsquo;s glory.&nbsp;
Now this righteousness is indeed a justifying righteousness: it
is the righteousness of Christ, the righteousness of God, perfect
in every thought, perfect from eternity.&nbsp; For ever, and for
ever, has he been one with God, and never for one single moment,
has one single tainted thought dared to intrude on the heavenly
holiness of his most holy soul.&nbsp; Now if this righteousness
be imputed to us, what can ours add to it?&nbsp; If we be
justified by Christ&rsquo;s merit, how is it possible that we
should be any longer justified by our own?&nbsp; Can ours add to
his?&nbsp; Can it supply any defects in his?&nbsp; Can we make up
a patchwork righteousness, partly his, and partly ours?&nbsp; The
very holiest act of the very holiest of men would be like a spot
upon the sun, a stain and blemish to the perfect brilliancy of
the holiness of Jesus.</p>
<p>Now that is the justifying righteousness of the
believer.&nbsp; In Christ we stand, in Christ we are accepted, in
Christ the law is satisfied, in Christ we are free from the
curse, in Christ we have <a name="page33"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 33</span>peace with God&mdash;so in Christ,
and in Christ alone, must the true believer look for life.</p>
<p>Away, then, with all false thoughts of human merit; away with
the deadly heresy that man by inherent excellence can recommend
himself to God; away with the self-exalting notion that any man,
at any time, can stand in any other attitude than that of a
convicted sinner, freely pardoned through the blood of the
Lamb.&nbsp; We will strive to please him, we will press on along
the path of life, we will spare nothing that we may walk with
God.&nbsp; We will long for the day when Christ&rsquo;s image
shall be formed in perfection within the soul.&nbsp; But,
meanwhile, we will rest on his atonement, on his righteousness
alone: and though worldly men may count it folly, though
self-righteous men may deem it frenzy, though Rome may hurl
against us the thunder of her anathemas, we will believe, and
believe to our everlasting peace and joy, that &ldquo;God hath
made him to be sin for us&rdquo;; and that by that one act,
without the smallest human merit, &ldquo;We are made the
righteousness of God in him.&rdquo;</p>
<h2><a name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 34</span>SERMON
III.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">PURGATORY.</span></h2>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center"><span
class="smcap">Luke</span> xxiii. 43.</p>
<p>And Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, To day shalt
thou be with me in paradise.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">Have</span> you ever stood by the bedside
of a dying believer? ever watched the decaying strength of some
dear object of your fondest love?&nbsp; Then you know the deep
emotions of that solemn moment, when, in the stillness of the
chamber of death, the heavy breathing ceases, and the happy
spirit wings its flight to God.&nbsp; What conflicting feelings
then struggle for mastery in the heart!&nbsp; Faith, joy, doubt,
and sorrow, seem in turn to take possession of the soul: nay,
rather! they all reign there at once: we mourn in widowhood, but
acquiesce in faith: we look on our own life as desolate through
separation; but, thinking on the present glory of the departed,
we cannot withhold a glad Amen from Cowper&rsquo;s lines upon his
mother.</p>
<blockquote><p>But oh! the thought that thou art safe and he!<br
/>
That thought is joy, arise what may to me.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes it is a joy! a mournful joy, but a joy unutterable; <a
name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 35</span>a joy that
draws from the same eye tears of rejoicing, and tears of grief; a
joy which, strange to say, melts us into sadness, while it gives
a calm, holy, peaceful satisfaction from the full and complete
assurance that those we love most are for ever safe with
Jesus.&nbsp; This joy is the birthright of God&rsquo;s faithful
children; and this the balm with which in our funeral service, we
strive to staunch the mourner&rsquo;s tears.&nbsp; Who that has
ever wept beside the open grave can fail to remember those
hallowed words: &ldquo;I heard a voice from heaven saying unto
me, Write, from henceforth, blessed are the dead which die in the
Lord, even so saith the Spirit, for they rest from their
labours&rdquo;?</p>
<p>But the Church of Rome, at one fatal blow, robs us of all
this; and in the Catechism of the Council of Trent, declares, <a
name="citation35a"></a><a href="#footnote35a"
class="citation">[35a]</a> &ldquo;Besides (hell,) there is a fire
of purgatory, in which the souls of the pious being tormented for
a definite time, expiate their sin, that so an entrance may be
opened to them, into the eternal country, into which nothing
defiled can enter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>You will here observe four things.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; That the souls in purgatory are under torture.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Cruciat&aelig;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; That this torture is by fire. <a
name="citation35b"></a><a href="#footnote35b"
class="citation">[35b]</a></p>
<p>3.&nbsp; That the persons suffering it are not the wicked, but
the pious, i.e. believers, God&rsquo;s dear <a
name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 36</span>children,
those to whom Christ would say, &ldquo;Depart in peace, thy faith
hath saved thee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; That the purpose of it is to expiate sin, or make an
atonement for transgression before they can be admitted to
eternal glory.</p>
<p>So that if we are to believe Rome, we must abandon all our
bright hopes for our dear departed brethren.&nbsp; Our mothers,
and fathers, and fond friends, who have stuck closer to us than a
brother, holy believers, who full of faith, fell asleep in Jesus,
are at this present moment, writhing and gnashing their teeth, in
the fierce agony of scorching heat; yet glad even of the flame to
hide them from the displeasure of that Saviour whom they once
delighted to trust and love.</p>
<p>Having thus stated the doctrine, I am well persuaded I might
here safely leave it.&nbsp; But it forms one of the bulwarks of
the Romish system, and is one of the great sources of Roman
wealth. <a name="citation36a"></a><a href="#footnote36a"
class="citation">[36a]</a>&nbsp; The parish priests are ordered
by their church frequently and diligently to discourse on it. <a
name="citation36b"></a><a href="#footnote36b"
class="citation">[36b]</a>&nbsp; Let us examine then how the
matter stands in the word of God.</p>
<p>I.&nbsp; And 1st, we would remark that there is not a shadow
of foundation for it in the Bible.&nbsp; We read of hell, and we
read of heaven; we read plainly, &ldquo;That where the tree
falleth there shall it lie.&rdquo;&nbsp; But of purgatory not a
word is to be found.</p>
<p>There are, however, two texts generally quoted to which it may
be well briefly to refer.</p>
<p><a name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 37</span>The
first is, 1 Cor. iii. 12&ndash;15.&nbsp; &ldquo;Now if any man
build upon this foundation gold, silver, precious stones, wood,
hay, stubble; every man&rsquo;s work shall be made manifest: for
the day shall declare it, because it shall be revealed by fire;
and the tire shall try every man&rsquo;s work of what sort it
is.&nbsp; If any man&rsquo;s work abide which he hath built
thereupon, he shall receive a reward.&nbsp; If any man&rsquo;s
work shall be burned, he shall suffer loss: but he himself shall
be saved; yet so as by fire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One glance is enough to shew that these words have no
connection with the subject.&nbsp; The apostle is speaking of the
ministry, and compares the ministers who followed him at Corinth
to builders raising a temple on the foundation he himself had
laid.&nbsp; The temple then is the visible Church; the material,
the professing members of it: some of whom, like gold, silver,
and precious stones, are shining as true believers to the glory
of their Saviour: others, like wood, hay, and stubble, are
worthless professors, fit only to be burned.&nbsp; The day of
revealing fire refers either to the day of judgment, or the great
fearful conflict with the enemy, described by St. Peter as
&ldquo;the fiery trial which is to try you.&rdquo; <a
name="citation37"></a><a href="#footnote37"
class="citation">[37]</a>&nbsp; The effect will be to separate
the tares from the wheat; the precious from the vile; the false
from the true; the gold, silver, and precious stones, from the
wood, hay, and stubble; and so to reveal the character of the
work.&nbsp; There is no allusion then to purgatory.&nbsp; The
fire of purgatory is to make expiation for the sins of believers;
the day of fire <a name="page38"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
38</span>here described is to try the Church and reveal its
character.</p>
<p>If possible the other passage has still less bearing on the
subject.&nbsp; It is, 1 Pet. iii. 18&ndash;20.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Being put to death in the flesh, but quickened in the
spirit: by the which also he went and preached unto the spirits
in prison: which sometimes were disobedient, when once the
longsuffering of God waited in the days of Noah, while the ark
was a preparing, wherein few, that is, eight souls were saved by
water.&rdquo;&nbsp; This is said to prove that our blessed Lord
preached to the spirits in purgatory at his burial.&nbsp; But it
does nothing of the kind.&nbsp; Those that had sinned against
Noah&rsquo;s preaching were guilty of disobedience and
unbelief.&nbsp; They, therefore, the Church of Rome itself being
witness, were not in purgatory but in hell.&nbsp; The true
meaning of the text is this: Christ was raised up by the divine
power of the Holy Ghost, by which as the eternal God, he preached
even in the time of Noah to those wicked persons, who having then
rejected him, are now fast bound in the miseries of hell.&nbsp;
He preached then, not at the time of the crucifixion, but, as the
pre-existent God, at the time of Noah: and preached not to dead
souls, but to living men.&nbsp; These two texts are the pillars
on which Purgatory rests.&nbsp; They remind us of the two pillars
on which stood the house of Dagon.&nbsp; God grant that they may
not be equally destructive to the thousands of souls who rest on
them!</p>
<p>There is therefore no support for the doctrine; let us now
proceed to show,</p>
<p>II.&nbsp; That it is in direct contradiction to the word of
God.</p>
<p><a name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 39</span>There
are many passages to which we should feel great joy in now
referring, where the present blessedness of departed spirits is
painted in lively colours by the Holy Ghost; but you will at once
see that those only concern our present argument, which describe
an <i>immediate</i> entrance into joy and rest.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; Let us begin then with the language of our blessed
Saviour to the dying thief; which shows that they are gathered
immediately to a joyful home; &ldquo;To day thou shalt be with me
in paradise.&rdquo;&nbsp; There can be no question here as to his
immediate happiness; there was no need of prayer for the repose
of his soul.&nbsp; That very afternoon, when his poor exhausted
frame hung lifeless on the cross, when he was carried off as an
unclean thing to be buried out of the sight of man; that very
afternoon, before the evening closed in, was the happy spirit in
paradise with Jesus.&nbsp; And there is something very beautiful
in the name here given to the home of Spirits.&nbsp; In 2 Cor. v.
1, it is described as &ldquo;a building of God, an house not made
with hands, eternal in the heavens;&rdquo; but there is no name
given there; here the name is given, but no description; the name
is &ldquo;Paradise.&rdquo;&nbsp; In paradise there was no pain,
no sickness, no sorrow, no death, no sin.&nbsp; Tears were never
witnessed there till Adam turned his back on it, and so it is
with the home of believers.&nbsp; Neither sin nor sorrow can ever
gain admission.&nbsp; The gate is too strait for them, they are
left behind with us on earth.&nbsp; In that home holiness is the
joy, praise the incense, love the atmosphere, and Christ the
light.</p>
<p><a name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
40</span>2.&nbsp; In this home again there is immediate
rest.&nbsp; &ldquo;They rest not day and night,&rdquo; it is
true, &ldquo;crying, <a name="citation40a"></a><a
href="#footnote40a" class="citation">[40a]</a> Holy, holy, holy,
&amp;c.;&rdquo; for to them nothing could be so fatiguing as a
pause from praise.&nbsp; Their most toilsome toil is to be silent
from giving thanks.&nbsp; But from all labour they rest at
once.&nbsp; When the spirit once takes its flight, to that soul
the warfare is accomplished, the struggle over, the battle
won.&nbsp; Only look at the words of St. John, Revelation xiv.
13.&nbsp; See how they are ushered in.&nbsp; &ldquo;I heard a
voice from heaven.&rdquo;&nbsp; See how God would have them
preserved as the lasting joy of the Church of Christ; for he
says, &ldquo;Write.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mark their confirmation by the
Holy Ghost, &ldquo;Yea, thus saith the Spirit.&rdquo;&nbsp; And
now see their plain, indisputable testimony to the immediate and
complete blessedness of the saints.&nbsp; &ldquo;Blessed are the
dead which die in the Lord from henceforth, yea, thus saith the
Spirit, that they may rest from their labours; and their works do
follow them.&rdquo;&nbsp; There is no delay, no interval, no
expiation.&nbsp; They are at once blessed; at once at rest; for
they are fallen asleep in Jesus: they have died in the Lord.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; This immediate blessedness is taught us also from the
case of Lazarus. <a name="citation40b"></a><a href="#footnote40b"
class="citation">[40b]</a> &ldquo;When the beggar died he was
carried by the angels into Abraham&rsquo;s bosom,&rdquo; not to
purgatory; and when there he was comforted in the enjoyment of a
rest with God.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; But above all, the dying spirit passes immediately
into the presence of Christ the Saviour.</p>
<p><a name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 41</span>It is
most important for us to observe this, for there can be no real
joy to the Christian if he be separate from Christ.&nbsp; The
pure river of the fountain of life would lose all its charm if it
did not proceed out of the throne of God and of the Lamb.&nbsp;
The sea of glass, clear as crystal, would have no beauty if the
face of Jesus were not reflected in it.&nbsp; The new Jerusalem
itself would be no object of desire, though its walls be of
jasper, its gate of pearl, its streets of gold, if Christ himself
were not the light of it: for the brightest diamond has no
brightness in the dark.&nbsp; Yea, heaven itself would become a
hell if the Son of God were not the reigning Lord of it.</p>
<p>If we cannot prove, therefore, that the departed believer
passes at once into the presence of his Lord, we in fact prove
nothing.&nbsp; If for one moment we are to be separated from him,
it little matters where.&nbsp; But thanks be to God we can prove
it without the possibility of contradiction.</p>
<p>When Stephen died <a name="citation41a"></a><a
href="#footnote41a" class="citation">[41a]</a> &ldquo;he saw the
glory of God, and Jesus standing at the right hand of God;&rdquo;
saw, as it were, the arm of Christ reaching forth to draw him up
to heaven; so he fell down and prayed &ldquo;Lord Jesus receive
my spirit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When St. Paul doubted between life and death, he <a
name="citation41b"></a><a href="#footnote41b"
class="citation">[41b]</a> &ldquo;had a desire to depart and be
with Christ, which was far better.&rdquo;&nbsp; Death then was a
departure into the immediate presence of his Lord.&nbsp; But
above all refer to 2 Cor. v. 6, 7, 8.&nbsp; &ldquo;Therefore we
are always confident, knowing that, whilst <a
name="page42"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 42</span>we are at
home in the body we are absent from the Lord; (for we walk by
faith not by sight;) we are confident, I say, and willing rather
to be absent from the body, and to be present with the
Lord.&rdquo;&nbsp; The idea of this passage is that there are two
homes for believers; two dwellings, one on earth, and one in
heaven; one in the body, one in the presence of our Lord.&nbsp;
While here we know him, but it is by faith alone.&nbsp; &ldquo;We
walk by faith, not by sight.&rdquo;&nbsp; When there we shall see
him in the full brilliancy of his love and glory.&nbsp; And this
change is immediate.&nbsp; The veil is very thin that separates
the world of flesh from the world of spirits.&nbsp; Every prayer
of faith pierces it.&nbsp; The stream is very narrow that
separates earth and heaven, and no sooner do we quit the one than
we enter on the other; no sooner is the earthly home dissolved,
than Christ himself is seen and the heavenly home opens for his
people.&nbsp; So long as &ldquo;we are at home in the body, we
are absent from the Lord;&rdquo; and we are willing rather to be
absent from the body and to be present with the Lord.&nbsp; The
departed believer, therefore, is at once found with Christ.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; But there is another passage in which all these
immediate blessings appear summed up in one short, but most
expressive, word.&nbsp; &ldquo;To me to live is Christ, and to
die is gain.&rdquo; <a name="citation42"></a><a
href="#footnote42" class="citation">[42]</a></p>
<p>We should have no fear in resting the question upon this text
alone.&nbsp; It places the truth beyond the reach of all
attack.&nbsp; &ldquo;To die is gain,&rdquo; therefore to die is
not to go to purgatory.&nbsp; &ldquo;To die <a
name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 43</span>is
gain,&rdquo; therefore to die is not to be tortured in fire for
the expiation of our sin.&nbsp; Nor must we suppose that this
refers to St. Paul alone.&nbsp; His acceptance rested on the same
terms as ours.&nbsp; He was a sinner pardoned through the
Lamb&rsquo;s blood, and accepted on the same terms as the weakest
believer in our congregation.&nbsp; To die was gain; not because
he was an Apostle, but because to live was Christ.&nbsp; And if
to us to live is Christ, then to us to die is gain.</p>
<p>Look then at the present happiness of believers, the present
joy of the new born child of God.&nbsp; He does not see Christ,
it is true, with the eye of sense; but he knows him, he loves
him, he delights in him, he speaks to him, his soul is filled
with joy at the assurance of his grace.&nbsp; &ldquo;Whom having
not seen we love, in whom though now ye see him not, yet
believing ye rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of
glory.&rdquo;&nbsp; In every care and trial he can find a sweet
repose, for he knows that Christ is near, and he has the precious
promise &ldquo;The beloved of the Lord shall dwell in safety by
him; and the Lord shall cover him all the day long.&rdquo;&nbsp;
So when his frame becomes enfeebled and the time of his departure
seems at hand, he can lie down peacefully upon the bed of
languishing, for he has the precious promise that the Lord shall
strengthen him; the sweet assurance &ldquo;<i>Thou</i> wilt make
<i>all</i> his bed in his sickness.&rdquo;&nbsp; Ay! and when the
illness itself draws to a close, when all power to alleviate is
gone, when the physician&rsquo;s skill is helpless, and the
wife&rsquo;s affection fruitless; when the dying man is passing
<a name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 44</span>alone
through the valley of the shadow of death, he is still supported,
still happy, still at peace.&nbsp; For the same Lord is
nigh.&nbsp; &ldquo;Yea, though I walk through the valley of the
shadow of death I will fear no evil: for thou art with me, thy
rod and thy staff, they comfort me.&rdquo;&nbsp; Oh!&nbsp;
Blessed life!&nbsp; Oh! happy death of the child of God!&nbsp;
&ldquo;Let me die the death of the righteous, and let my last end
be like his!&rdquo; <a name="citation44"></a><a
href="#footnote44" class="citation">[44]</a></p>
<p>But now suppose the valley crossed.&nbsp; The arm has upheld
him through the struggle; the beloved of the Lord has been borne
safely through.&nbsp; Is the first sight which meets his
affrighted eye the lurid glare of the flashing flames of
purgatorial fire?&mdash;the first sound that startles his ear the
groaning of God&rsquo;s beloved children writhing under the
torments of expiating torture?&nbsp; Is that calm repose on Jesus
suddenly changed by one terrific plunge into the scorching agony
of a purgatorial flame?&nbsp; Would it be gain thus to die?&nbsp;
Would such a death be &ldquo;far better&rdquo; than the life of
faith?&nbsp; It would be better surely to dwell safely as the
beloved of the Lord, than to burn miserably in the expiation of
unforgiven sin.</p>
<p>We may conclude then that the doctrine of purgatory is in
direct opposition to the word of God, but we have a yet farther,
and, if possible, graver charge to urge against it, viz.,</p>
<p>III.&nbsp; That it is in direct opposition to the doctrine of
atonement as set forth in scripture.</p>
<p>You will remember the extract already quoted from the
Catechism of the Council of Trent, in <a name="page45"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 45</span>which it was stated that in the fire
of purgatory the souls of the pious make expiation for their
sin.&nbsp; Pause for a moment to observe these words.&nbsp; There
are two things to be noticed in them, (1.) they assert directly
that man&rsquo;s sufferings can make expiation for his sin, and
(2.) they imply that the death of our Lord was not a complete
expiation for our sin.&nbsp; Let us examine each part
separately.</p>
<p>(1.)&nbsp; First then we have a direct assertion that by
enduring pain the believer makes expiation for his soul; that is,
that our temporary sufferings satisfy God&rsquo;s broken law.</p>
<p>If this be true, what occasion was there for the blood of
Jesus.&nbsp; Why the stupendous mystery of man&rsquo;s
redemption?&nbsp; Why the agony in the garden?&nbsp; Why the
burden of the cross?&nbsp; Why the hiding of God&rsquo;s
countenance?&nbsp; Why the endurance of the curse in our
stead?&nbsp; Such a work was surely needless, a mere mistake on
the part of Jesus.&nbsp; The atonement is become a fable, if
man&rsquo;s passing pain can make expiation for his sin.</p>
<p>But, again, if pain is expiation, how is it that hell-fire
burns for ever?&nbsp; Was ever suffering so intense as
that?&nbsp; Was there ever such a scene of woe and misery, of
hatefulness and hopelessness, as that?&nbsp; But does it make
expiation for the sinner&rsquo;s sin?&nbsp; Does it blot out the
curse?&nbsp; Does the fire burn out its fuel?&nbsp; &ldquo;It is
the worm that dieth not, and the fire that is not
quenched.&rdquo;&nbsp; Yea, verily, if the curse of one single
sin could be burned out by ten thousand centuries of pain, hell
would be no <a name="page46"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
46</span>longer hell, for there would be a faint gleam of far
distant hope, shining even upon the miseries of the damned.</p>
<p>There is no expiation then in pain.&nbsp; Believers are
chastened, but chastening is not atonement.&nbsp; It is
God&rsquo;s gentle discipline by which he prepares his jewels for
his crown; and just as the finest gold is wrought most carefully,
so the most precious of God&rsquo;s children are often chastened
most heavily, for &ldquo;whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth, and
scourgeth every son whom he receiveth.&rdquo;&nbsp; There must be
a melting of the gold, before it can be separated from the ore;
there must be a rending of the root, before the tree can be taken
from the wilderness and transplanted into the garden of the
Lord.&nbsp; And so it is with believers.&nbsp; There must be a
melting of the heart, a humbling of the earthly will, a weaning
of soul, that they may cleave to Christ alone.&nbsp; And this is
the purpose for which, beloved, we are chastened.&nbsp; He does
it for our profit, that we may be partakers of his
holiness.&nbsp; Affliction has the same effect that
Nebuchadnezzar&rsquo;s furnace had on the three children in
captivity.&nbsp; It could not touch their person, but it burnt
the bands that bound them, and enabled them to walk more freely
with their Lord.&nbsp; But expiation!&nbsp; That is
Christ&rsquo;s work.&nbsp; &ldquo;He is the propitiation for our
sins,&rdquo; and if suffering in man could expiate for sin in
man, then the suffering of Christ were a waste of blood, a waste
of agony, a waste of life, a waste of love.</p>
<p>(2.)&nbsp; And this leads us to our second remark, that the
doctrine of expiation through purgatorial <a
name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 47</span>fire implies
an incompleteness in the atonement of our blessed Lord.&nbsp; If
expiation be still needful, then in his atonement there must be
something wanting.&nbsp; Nor is this the mere conclusion of a
bigoted protestant, it is the bold assertion of the Church of
Rome herself.&nbsp; Listen to her canon, &ldquo;If any man shall
say that after the gift of Justification has been received, sin
is so remitted to any repentant sinner,&rdquo; (observe it speaks
of justified believers and true penitents) &ldquo;and the debt of
eternal punishment so blotted out, that there remains no debt of
temporary punishment to be endured either in this world or the
world to come in purgatory, before a way can be opened into the
kingdom of heaven, let him be Anathema.&rdquo; <a
name="citation47"></a><a href="#footnote47"
class="citation">[47]</a></p>
<p>I feel utterly at a loss in attempting to speak on such an
awful passage.&nbsp; Can they remember <a name="page48"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 48</span>that they are speaking of the
atonement wrought by the Son of God?&nbsp; He gave his own most
precious life to satisfy the law, and can any portion of the debt
remain?&nbsp; He purchased us with the price of his own most
precious blood: is farther payment needed?&nbsp; The eternal
Redeemer was our ransom: are we not free?&nbsp; The well beloved
of the Father endured the curse as our substitute: was his work
so ineffectual that the curse still hangs over the very men he
came to save?&nbsp; Awful dishonour to the Son of God!&nbsp; Now
Rome thou must indeed be Antichrist, for thou dost rob Christ of
his glory; thou strivest to tarnish the beauty of his
diadem.&nbsp; He says &ldquo;Behold the Lamb of God that takest
away the sins of the world.&rdquo;&nbsp; But thou contradictest
Christ and sayest that there is a remnant left to be punished in
the believer still.&nbsp; He says &ldquo;I, even I, am he, that
blotteth out thy transgressions for mine own sake, and will not
remember thy sins.&rdquo;&nbsp; But thou sayest that the blot is
not effaced, that the sin is still remembered, still punished,
even in the child of God.&nbsp; He says &ldquo;I am the
way,&rdquo; &ldquo;I am the door; by me if any man enter in he
shall be saved.&rdquo;&nbsp; But thou sayest that the door cannot
be opened, except it be through purgatorial pain.&nbsp; He says
that he has loved us and washed us from our sins in his own
blood, and made us kings and priests unto God and the
Father.&nbsp; But thou sayest the washing was incomplete, for sin
must after all be burned out by fire; that love is still
defective, for the saints must yet be punished; the inheritance
not fully purchased, for, after all that Christ has <a
name="page49"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 49</span>done, the
justified believer has still to make an expiation for his sin. <a
name="citation49"></a><a href="#footnote49"
class="citation">[49]</a></p>
<p>No! beloved! we will not for a moment admit the thought of any
other expiation, than that wrought out for us by the Lamb of
God.&nbsp; And as for our dear departed brethren, nothing that <a
name="page50"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 50</span>Rome can say
shall ever rob us of our delightful hope.&nbsp; They have felt no
pain since the day we parted; their sainted spirits have been
basking in the sunshine of the countenance of God.&nbsp; I myself
have parted with a mother, such a mother that I often wonder if
the world can ever more behold her equal: so strong in faith; so
ardent in her thirsting after God; so pure in spirit; so
sensitive to sin; so beaming in her holy loveliness, that you
might almost believe you saw the Father&rsquo;s name written
legibly by the Holy Ghost upon her forehead.&nbsp; To this day do
I hear the tones of her dying voice, when in answer to my
questions respecting her soul&rsquo;s peace, she replied &ldquo;I
can reverently say with the deepest humility, &lsquo;Lord, thou
knowest all things, thou knowest that I love
thee.&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp; And I would rather have this arm torn
from its socket, I would rather be scorched and scathed in
Moloch&rsquo;s fire, than I would abandon my firm and fixed
persuasion that such love has never been interrupted, that her
Redeeming Lord has never left her for a moment; my perfect
assurance, that while we were weeping in solemn stillness around
her bed of death, she was taking her place amongst the company of
palm bearers, and is now standing before the throne, having
washed her robes, and made them white in the blood of the
Lamb.</p>
<p>So also for ourselves! dear brethren! for we too must die; our
day is hastening on, our time drawing to its close.&nbsp; A few
short years and multitudes amongst us must change their faith for
sight, the world of flesh for the world of spirits: a few, short,
rapid years, and every one, <a name="page51"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 51</span>both you and I, shall find ourselves
in heaven or in hell.&nbsp; But let us fear nothing.&nbsp; Only
let us be found in Christ, justified through his blood, with our
name written in his book of life, and the Father&rsquo;s name
engraven by the Holy Ghost on our forehead, and then neither
death or hell can ever prevail to hurt us.&nbsp; In Christ we are
safe; washed in his blood we are completely pardoned; clad in his
righteousness we are completely justified; and kept in his right
hand we are completely and for ever safe.</p>
<p>Only let us be found in Christ.&nbsp; Then the outward man may
decay; the poor frame may wax faint and feeble; the eye may
become dim, even with the dim fixedness of death: and then, when
all earthly power has sunk under exhaustion, the eye will open; a
new world will spring up before us; attendant angels will hover
around the new-born citizen of heaven; and without tears, or
fears, or weakness, we shall behold Christ in the brightness of
his glory, and cry aloud in the heartfelt thankfulness of
unutterable joy, &ldquo;Salvation to our God which sitteth upon
the throne and unto the Lamb.&rdquo;</p>

<blockquote><p style="text-align: center"><span

<p>But this man, after he had offered one sacrifice for sins, for
ever sat down on the right hand of God.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">There</span> was never a more tremendous
judgment than that uttered by the voice of Malachi, <a
name="citation52"></a><a href="#footnote52"
class="citation">[52]</a> &ldquo;I will curse your
blessings.&rdquo;&nbsp; There can be no scourge more heavy than a
blessing cursed.&nbsp; The more choice the gift, the more fatal
is the misuse of it; the richer the blessing, the deadlier its
corruption.&nbsp; So it was with Christ himself.&nbsp; He was the
most precious gift that could be found even in the treasuries of
heaven&mdash;the well beloved Son of God; but to those who
rejected him he became a stone of stumbling and rock of
offence.&nbsp; So it has been with that sacred feast, which he
left as a parting legacy to his church.&nbsp; The Sacrament of
the Lord&rsquo;s Supper is one of the richest blessings in the
church&rsquo;s birthright.&nbsp; It is a sacred opportunity of
feeding in faith upon the body and blood of the Lamb, a perpetual
remembrance of his boundless grace, a bond of holy <a
name="page53"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 53</span>fellowship
with our brethren in the faith, a sacred pledge of our union and
communion with the Lord.&nbsp; Yet even this has been
corrupted.&nbsp; As with the Jews of old, so with professing
Christians &ldquo;their table has become a snare before them, and
that which should have been for their welfare has become a
trap.&rdquo; <a name="citation53a"></a><a href="#footnote53a"
class="citation">[53a]</a>&nbsp; We allude, of course, to the
doctrine of transubstantiation, of which the Council of Trent
decrees as follows:</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the consecration of the bread and wine there is
effected a change in the whole substance of the bread into the
substance of the body of Christ our Lord, and of the whole
substance of the wine into the substance of his blood.&rdquo; <a
name="citation53b"></a><a href="#footnote53b"
class="citation">[53b]</a>&nbsp; Here we have the bread and wine
transformed into the actual substance of the person of our
blessed Lord: so transformed that according to the Catechism <a
name="citation53c"></a><a href="#footnote53c"
class="citation">[53c]</a> there are &ldquo;bones and nerves in
it.&rdquo;&nbsp; Nay, more! so changed that there is actually his
whole person, not excepting his soul and his divinity, for the
Council declares <a name="citation53d"></a><a href="#footnote53d"
class="citation">[53d]</a> &ldquo;If any man shall say that the
body and blood of the Lord Jesus <a name="page54"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 54</span>Christ, together with his soul and
divinity, and, in short, that a whole Christ, is not contained
truly, really, and substantially in the sacrament of the most
Holy Eucharist, but shall say that he is in it only in sign, or
figure, or power, let him be anathema.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There is no misunderstanding such words as these.&nbsp; And if
there were, the 6th canon shows how Rome herself interprets them,
for she not only acknowledges the fact, but follows it
consistently to its conclusion, and declares plainly that we are
to worship it with the worship due to God. <a
name="citation54"></a><a href="#footnote54"
class="citation">[54]</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;If any shall say that in the Holy Sacrament of the
Eucharist, Christ, the only begotten Son of God, is not to be
adored, and that outwardly with the worship of Latria (the
worship paid to God), and that he ought not to be . . . carried
solemnly about in processions, or that he ought not to be set
before the people that he may be worshipped, and that the
worshippers of him are idolaters, let him be anathema.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But even this is not all: for not merely do they claim the
power of thus making the bread into <a name="page55"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 55</span>the very person of the only begotten
of the Father, they add yet this also, that they can put that
Saviour to death, and by that sacrifice make a propitiation for
the sins of the dead and living.&nbsp; The Council of Trent
declares <a name="citation55a"></a><a href="#footnote55a"
class="citation">[55a]</a> &ldquo;In the sacrifice of the mass,
that same Christ is sacrificed without blood who once with blood
offered himself upon the cross.&rdquo;&nbsp; And in Canon iii. <a
name="citation55b"></a><a href="#footnote55b"
class="citation">[55b]</a> it adds that &ldquo;If any man shall
say that the sacrifice is not propitiatory and profits the
receiver only, and ought not to be offered for the living and the
dead, for sins, punishments, satisfaction, and other necessities,
let him be anathema.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Such is the doctrine of transubstantiation as taught by the
Church of Rome.&nbsp; According to it by a few words of
consecration a wafer of unleavened bread is transformed into the
very person of the Son of God: a man may be worshipping with
divine honour in the afternoon a morsel of that same wheaten
flour on which he made his breakfast in the morning: the one half
he may bake for the sustenance of his children, the other he may
be bound to adore when the priest has transubstantiated it into
God.&nbsp; On reading such a doctrine it is impossible altogether
to forget God&rsquo;s cutting language against the sin of
Israel.</p>
<p><a name="page56"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
56</span>&ldquo;He burneth part of it in the fire; with part
thereof he eateth flesh; he roasteth roast, and is satisfied:
yea, he warmeth himself, and saith, Aha! I am warm, I have seen
the fire: and the residue thereof he maketh a god, even his
graven image: he falleth down unto it, and prayeth unto it, and
saith, deliver me for thou art my god.&rdquo; <a
name="citation56"></a><a href="#footnote56"
class="citation">[56]</a></p>
<p>Surely, then, it is reasonable to ask that the truth of such a
principle should be tried by the word of God alone.&nbsp; It is
opposed to the evidence of our senses, it is opposed to reason,
and it is no less opposed to the general tenor of the sacred
scriptures.&nbsp; It is a case, therefore, in which no human
evidence can avail any thing; the best, the wisest, the holiest
of men, are wholly insufficient witnesses to prove, that what is
apparently a piece of bread, lifeless, motionless, and powerless,
is the very person of Christ himself, the only begotten of the
Father, reigning triumphantly at the right hand of the throne of
God.&nbsp; Such a fact, if it be a fact, must be taught by God
himself.</p>
<p>At the same time, if God has said it we are bound cheerfully
to believe it.&nbsp; It is condemned by every faculty which God
has given us; it is opposed to experience, and to every
pre-existent principle of religion, yet so complete should be our
submission to the Bible, so absolute and unquestioning our
conviction of its certain truth, that if we clearly find even
transubstantiation there, we must believe without a murmur, we
must abandon all human thoughts in submission to his all perfect
<a name="page57"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
57</span>wisdom.&nbsp; Yea though our revered church declares it
plainly both &ldquo;a blasphemous fable and a dangerous
deceit;&rdquo; <a name="citation57"></a><a href="#footnote57"
class="citation">[57]</a> though the martyred fathers of the
Reformation chose rather to die in agony than admit its truth;
yet if God says it we will joyfully believe it, &ldquo;for God is
in heaven and we upon earth, therefore must our words be
few.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By the word of God, then, let us proceed to try the question,
and we will examine the language of Scripture,</p>
<p>I.&nbsp; With reference to the sacrament of the Lord&rsquo;s
Supper;</p>
<p>II.&nbsp; With reference to the life and work of our blessed
Lord.</p>
<p>May the Holy Ghost lead us calmly, seriously, and
dispassionately to learn the truths of his own most holy
word!</p>
<p>I.&nbsp; The language of Scripture with reference to the
sacrament of the Lord&rsquo;s Supper.</p>
<p>The doctrine is supposed to rest upon the words of our blessed
Saviour, &ldquo;This is my body,&rdquo; or as they were revealed
to St. Paul, &ldquo;This is my body which is broken for
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This sentence is thought to contain a plain, literal,
absolute, assertion that the bread was changed into his body;
changed so completely that while the Saviour spoke the words,
that bread which he held within his hand, was his real, natural,
whole, and substantial person.&nbsp; The belief of the Church of
England is that the words have no such literal meaning; but were
employed to teach that the bread and wine were signs, figures, or
emblems of his body broken, and his <a name="page58"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 58</span>blood shed upon the cross. <a
name="citation58a"></a><a href="#footnote58a"
class="citation">[58a]</a>&nbsp; He says, &ldquo;I am the vine,
ye are the branches.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I am the door:&rdquo;
but none suppose that he was a real vine, a real door, or his
people real branches of a growing tree.&nbsp; St. Paul says
&ldquo;That rock was Christ:&rdquo; but none believe that the
flinty rock was in very fact a living man. <a
name="citation58b"></a><a href="#footnote58b"
class="citation">[58b]</a>&nbsp; In all these passages we never
doubt for a single moment what was the meaning of the Holy
Ghost.&nbsp; The vine and the rock represented Christ, and the
door was a figure of him.&nbsp; Just so we believe it to be with
the words of consecration; the bread was a figure of his body and
the wine of his blood.</p>
<p>That this is the true meaning of the passage seems to lie upon
its very surface.&nbsp; Let us turn to 1st Corinthians xi.&nbsp;
We shall there find that</p>
<p>1st.&nbsp; It is inconsistent to take the words literally; for
they are quite as explicit and literal when spoken of the wine as
of the bread.&nbsp; &ldquo;This is my body which is broken for
you.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;This cup is the New Testament in my
blood.&rdquo;&nbsp; But in this one passage there are no less
than three figures.&nbsp; The cup stands as the emblem or figure
of the wine contained in it; the new covenant is said to be the
New Testament <i>in</i> his blood, because it was sealed and
ratified by his blood; and the <a name="page59"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 59</span>cup itself is declared positively to
be the testament.&nbsp; This must be figurative, it must mean
that the cup is a sign, emblem, or figure of the testament.&nbsp;
Thus the warmest advocate of the doctrine of transubstantiation
is compelled to allow the use of figure with reference to the
cup.&nbsp; Is it consistent? is it defensible or any principle of
scriptural interpretation to deny it with reference to the bread?
ought they not to be interpreted on the same principles?&nbsp;
Here are two sentences, spoken at the same time, by the same
person, under the same circumstances, to the same company, and
for the same purpose.&nbsp; But there must be a figure in the
one, who shall deny it in the other?&nbsp; The cup must be an
emblem of the testament, can we be wrong in believing also that
the bread is an emblem of the body?</p>
<p>2d.&nbsp; But this is not all.&nbsp; We have besides the
direct testimony of the Holy Ghost that the bread remains bread,
and the wine remains wine after consecration.&nbsp; Of the wine
our Lord spoke in terms which it is quite impossible to mistake
or misinterpret.&nbsp; In Matthew xxvi. 29, he expressly says,
&ldquo;I will drink no more of this fruit of the vine until that
day when I drink it new with you in my Father&rsquo;s
kingdom.&rdquo;&nbsp; These words were spoken <i>after</i> the
consecration, and they seem uttered with especial caution as if
he had foreseen the error which was about to creep into his
professing church.&nbsp; He does not rest content with the name
of &ldquo;wine,&rdquo; but calls it &ldquo;fruit of the
vine,&rdquo; as if to prove beyond the possibility of a doubt
that it had gained no new substance, but remained as it was
before, the <a name="page60"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
60</span>natural produce of the vine, the simple unaltered juice
of the grape.&nbsp; Nor is the evidence less positive with
reference to the bread.&nbsp; Again and again do we read of the
breaking of the bread, never once of the sacrifice of the
body.&nbsp; Nor is this merely accidental, for in the 10th and
11th chapters of 1st Corinthians we have the bread called bread
by the Holy Ghost, no less than four times after
consecration.&nbsp; In 1 Cor. x. 17, the Christian communicant is
said to partake of bread, not of flesh with bones and nerves;
&ldquo;We are all partakers of that one
<i>bread</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; In 1 Cor. xi. 26, &ldquo;For as often
as ye eat this <i>bread</i>, and drink this <i>cup</i>, ye do
show the Lord&rsquo;s death till he come.&rdquo;&nbsp; In 27,
&ldquo;Whosoever shall eat this <i>bread</i>, and drink this
<i>cup</i> of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and
blood of the Lord;&rdquo; and 28, &ldquo;But let a man examine
himself, and so let him eat of that <i>bread</i>, and drink of
that <i>cup</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; We do not, therefore, rest on human
reason only when we deny the doctrine of
transubstantiation.&nbsp; We boldly cast ourselves upon the
teaching of the Bible, yea, upon the teaching of the Son of God
himself, and believe the bread to be still bread, and the wine to
remain as the fruit of the vine.&nbsp; We behold in them the
signs and symbols of the passion of our Lord; and beholding the
sign, we feed in faith on the reality.&nbsp; They are the figures
of himself; the representations of his passion; the emblems and
signs of his atoning death.&nbsp; As such we value, we receive,
we honour them: but we live on Christ himself; we rest on the
passion itself, on the atonement itself; and so by a strong,
spiritual, realizing faith we <a name="page61"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 61</span>are made partakers of his flesh and
blood.&nbsp; &ldquo;The words that I speak unto you they are
spirit, and they are life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>3rd.&nbsp; But if the words were to be taken literally, they
would not even then furnish the slightest proof of the doctrine
taught by Rome: for you will remember the canon <a
name="citation61"></a><a href="#footnote61"
class="citation">[61]</a> already quoted, which says, &ldquo;If
any man shall say that the body and blood of our Lord Jesus
Christ, together with his soul and divinity, and in short that a
whole Christ is not contained in the Sacrament, let him be
accursed.&rdquo;&nbsp; The utmost that the words of Jesus can be
understood as teaching is, that the bread is transubstantiated
into the body.&nbsp; The narrative is given by three Evangelists
and one Apostle; but in no single instance is there the least
mention made of his soul or spirit.&nbsp; He did not say,
&ldquo;This is my body, soul, and divinity.&rdquo;&nbsp; He said
simply, &ldquo;This is my body.&rdquo;&nbsp; They refer to it
exclusively, and this exclusiveness is marked in them with a
peculiar and distinctive point.&nbsp; If he had simply said,
&ldquo;This is my body,&rdquo; it might have been possible for a
lively imagination to clothe them with some reference to all the
properties of his sacred person; but by adding the words
&ldquo;Which is broken for you,&rdquo; he has given <a
name="page62"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 62</span>a definite
fixedness to their meaning; he has tied them down to a distinct
and exclusive application; he has showed that they refer simply
and solely to the real, human body; to that flesh through which
the nails were driven, to that human frame which was seen hanging
on the cross, which was embalmed by the women, and which lay
buried in the tomb of Joseph.</p>
<p>There is not, therefore, the faintest appearance of the least
shade of scriptural evidence, in support of the canon that the
bread is changed into the soul and divinity of our Lord.&nbsp; It
is an addition made by the church of Rome on her own simple,
unsupported, authority. <a name="citation62"></a><a
href="#footnote62" class="citation">[62]</a>&nbsp; There is not
one single passage, which, on any principle of interpretation,
can be forced or twisted into the most distant reference to such
a change.&nbsp; The Saviour said &ldquo;This is my
body.&rdquo;&nbsp; Rome adds, &ldquo;it is his soul and
divinity.&rdquo;&nbsp; And what an addition have we here!&nbsp;
The soul shudders at the thought that men dare presume to make
it!&nbsp; Had we the tongue of angels we should utterly fail to
describe the unutterable glory of the majesty of God.&nbsp; As
well might the insect swallow up the ocean as any finite creature
exhibit truly the unbounded vastness of an infinite
Jehovah.&nbsp; In Majesty incomprehensible he dwelleth in the
light which no man can approach unto: in power omnipotent he
created all things without one single atom of material substance:
in life eternal he dwelt <a name="page63"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 63</span>alone from the beginning, filling
with his own self the vast regions of unbounded space; and now
that he has peopled a universe with the countless creatures of
his skill, he is present everywhere, exhausted no where.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Do not I the Lord fill earth and heaven?&rdquo;&nbsp; Yet
does Rome venture on the unsupported authority of man to ascribe
all this to the unleavened wafer, and fearlessly to hurl her
curses against those who tremble at the thought of kneeling down
to the bread and wine, and adoring them with the worship which
belongs to the mighty God, the everlasting Father, the Prince of
Peace.&nbsp; &ldquo;If any man shall say that, he (i.e. the
transubstantiated wafer) is not to be adored with the worship due
to God, let him be accursed.&rdquo; <a name="citation63"></a><a
href="#footnote63" class="citation">[63]</a></p>
<p>II.&nbsp; We may pass then to our second point, and compare
the doctrine of transubstantiation with the teaching of Scripture
concerning both the life and work of Jesus.</p>
<p>And first we may remark that, according to the Bible, he now
lives and reigns in his complete and perfect manhood.&nbsp; This
appears very plainly in the language of our text.&nbsp;
&ldquo;But this man, after he had offered one sacrifice for sins,
for ever sat down on the right hand of God.&rdquo;&nbsp; The same
that made the offering is now seated at the right <a
name="page64"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 64</span>hand of
God.&nbsp; Yes! that same human person that was born of the
Virgin, that grew in stature, that was wearied at the well, that
slept in the ship, that thirsted on the cross, that was laid in
the new tomb of Joseph; that same person is the triumphant King
seated as a conqueror on the throne of God.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am he
that liveth and was dead, and behold I am alive for evermore,
Amen, and have the keys of hell and death.&rdquo; <a
name="citation64a"></a><a href="#footnote64a"
class="citation">[64a]</a></p>
<p>And this explains the language of Scripture, which describes
him in one defined and determined place, seated at the right hand
of God.&nbsp; In his divine nature he is God himself, and fills
earth and heaven.&nbsp; To the Son may we say as to the Father,
&ldquo;If I ascend up into heaven thou art there; if I make my
bed in hell thou art there.&rdquo;&nbsp; But in his human nature
he is perfect man, and as man limited.&nbsp; As Jehovah he is
omnipotent and created all things, but yet as man he was
dependent, and prayed for strength; so as Jehovah, he is
omnipresent, watching everywhere over the most hidden of his
scattered children, as man he has his one abiding place, and is
seated at the right hand of God.&nbsp; He was always omnipresent,
but when he went to Bethany he left Jerusalem.&nbsp; So too he is
as God now omnipresent everywhere, but when he went to the
Father, as man he left the presence of the church below.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It is expedient for you that I go away, for if I go not
away the Comforter will not come unto you, but if I depart I will
send him unto you.&rdquo; <a name="citation64b"></a><a
href="#footnote64b" class="citation">[64b]</a></p>
<p>Hence it is that he speaks of his ascension as a <a
name="page65"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 65</span>leaving of
the world; in the body he went to God, though in divine power he
never left his church on earth.&nbsp; Hence his second advent is
described as a coming back to his people; &ldquo;This same Jesus
which is taken up from you into heaven shall so come in like
manner as ye have seen him go into heaven.&rdquo; <a
name="citation65a"></a><a href="#footnote65a"
class="citation">[65a]</a>&nbsp; Hence, also, we are expressly
taught that until the appointed day shall dawn his habitation
will be heaven, and his seat the throne of God. <a
name="citation65b"></a><a href="#footnote65b"
class="citation">[65b]</a>&nbsp; &ldquo;Whom the heavens must
receive until the times of restitution of all things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We dare not, therefore, admit the thought that before his
advent his human person can be present with his church on
earth.&nbsp; The language of sacred scripture is plain and oft
repeated, that he has left the world, and is not to be seen in
person here; it leaves no space for doubt or imagination, but
teaches the believer to look on his risen Saviour in one place
and one alone; &ldquo;in heaven itself now to appear in the
presence of God for us.&rdquo;&nbsp; There he sits in triumphant
peace, having fought the fight, having won the victory, having
gained the crown.&nbsp; Thousand thousand saints attend him, ten
thousand times ten thousand bow before him, and not a murmur, not
a whisper, ever breaks for a moment the cheerful peace of his
dominion.&nbsp; Nothing there prevails to ruffle the calm surface
of that sea of glass, which, clear as crystal, reflects the
countenance of its reigning Lord.&nbsp; And though the troubled
passions of this lower world may be lashed into fury by the
action of universal sin; <a name="page66"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 66</span>though the waters thereof roar and be
troubled, though the mountains shake with the swelling thereof,
it cannot disturb the lowest pediment of his footstool; for
&ldquo;The Lord sitteth above the water-flood, the Lord sitteth
king for ever.&rdquo;&nbsp; And yet shall Rome tell us that we
are to adore in that piece of bread the very person of our
reigning Lord? that the wafer which can neither save itself from
the insect, from the reptile, or from putrefaction; and which, to
protect it, the Priest must shut carefully in the casket, is in
very truth the reigning Jesus, with all his life and all his
attributes?&nbsp; We might believe them possibly if they were to
tell us that they had plucked up Vesuvius by the roots, and cast
the huge mountain like a pebble into the deep.&nbsp; We might
perhaps listen to the tale, if the priest were to tell us that he
was about to stretch forth his bold hand, and tear down the sun
from its high place amongst the stars of heaven; but we will
never believe that any man, or set of men, on earth, can hold
within their hand, can shut within their casket, can carry in
their procession, or can kill at their pleasure, that living,
reigning Saviour, whom the Holy Ghost declares to be seated
triumphantly on the right hand of God.</p>
<p>(2)&nbsp; But the worst yet remains.&nbsp; Christ passed to
glory through the grave; his kingdom was bought by blood.&nbsp;
&ldquo;After he had made one offering for sin, he for ever sat
down at the right hand of God.&rdquo;&nbsp; See how that one
offering is affected by the doctrine of the mass.&nbsp; You will
remember the canon already quoted which declared that when the
mass was offered, a propitiatory <a name="page67"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 67</span>sacrifice was made for the sins both
of the dead and of the living.&nbsp; Now what does that
imply?&nbsp; Nothing short of this, that the atonement made by
Christ was neither complete, nor final: not complete, else where
the need of further sacrifice? not final, else where the
possibility of a repetition?&nbsp; But if there be any one point
on which the Holy Ghost has spoken more explicitly than another,
that one point is the final sufficiency of the work of Jesus.</p>
<p>It was complete.</p>
<p>By his one oblation of himself once offered, he made a full,
perfect, and sufficient sacrifice, oblation, and satisfaction for
the sins of the whole world.&nbsp; He paid the whole price, he
bore the whole curse.&nbsp; He left no room for further payment,
for any sacrifice in application of the one offering to the
sinner&rsquo;s case.&nbsp; That one atonement itself reached to
the lowest depths of the sinner&rsquo;s fall; it broke down every
barrier between the soul and God; it so completely blotted out
the curse that the Gospel message is, &ldquo;Believe and
live.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;By one offering he hath perfected for
them that are sanctified,&rdquo; v. 14.&nbsp; When Christ died
the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the
bottom; not half-way only.&nbsp; The way into the holiest was
then laid completely open.&nbsp; There was no second rending
needed; no drawing aside the curtain.&nbsp; There stood the mercy
seat in full view of the adoring multitude.&nbsp; So it is with
&ldquo;the new and living way which Christ has consecrated for us
through the veil, that is to say, his flesh.&rdquo;&nbsp; It lays
the way of life completely open to the sinner; and we only honour
God, when we believe, to our inexpressible joy, that <a
name="page68"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 68</span>a poor,
guilty, broken-hearted penitent, may, without money, without
price, and without sacrifice, enter in boldly, and through the
simple look of faith find life and peace to his soul.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thou shalt be
saved.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was final.</p>
<p>The passage from which our text is taken seems written with
prophetic reference to this very subject.&nbsp; It could not have
spoken with more plainness if we Protestants had composed it for
ourselves.&nbsp; No less than five times in these few verses does
the Holy Ghost declare that the propitiation made by Christ was
offered once, and once alone.</p>
<p>IX. 26.&nbsp; &ldquo;But now <i>once</i> in the end of the
world hath he appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of
himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>IX.&nbsp; 28.&nbsp; &ldquo;So Christ was <i>once</i> offered
to bear the sins of many.&rdquo;</p>
<p>X.&nbsp; 10.&nbsp; &ldquo;By the which will we are sanctified
through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ <i>once for
all</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>X. 12.&nbsp; &ldquo;But this man, after he had offered
<i>one</i> sacrifice for sins, for ever sat down on the right
hand of God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>X. 14.&nbsp; &ldquo;For by <i>one</i> offering he hath
perfected for ever them that are sanctified.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If there were any possibility of mistaking these plain and oft
repeated words, even that would be removed by the slightest
glance at the pointed argument in which we find them.&nbsp; The
Apostle is drawing a contrast between the gospel and the law;
between the priesthood of Christ and that <a
name="page69"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 69</span>of the sons
of Levi.&nbsp; Now mark the especial point of contrast; their
sacrifices being imperfect require frequent repetition, his being
perfect was made once, and for ever, upon the cross.</p>
<p>IX. 25 and 26.&nbsp; &ldquo;Nor yet that he should offer
himself often, as the High Priest entereth into the holy place
every year with blood of others; for then must he often have
suffered since the foundation of the world, but now once in the
end of the world hath he appeared to put away sin by the
sacrifice of himself.&rdquo;&nbsp; The whole argument turns upon
the impossibility of repetition in the sacrifice of our
Lord.&nbsp; If that can be repeated the whole contrast falls to
the ground.</p>
<p>There is, therefore, the most complete, clear, and explicit
proof that Christ could be no more offered, and that propitiation
could be no more made for sin.&nbsp; Yea, verily, so complete is
that perfect work already finished by Christ as our substitute;
so perfect is that satisfaction which he made upon the cross for
the sins of man, that if the whole of that sad scene were once
more enacted upon Calvary; if the crown of thorns were once more
placed on his head; if his holy frame were once more broken and
bowed down by death; neither his agony nor death could avail one
jot, or one tittle, to the blotting out of one single
sinner&rsquo;s sin.&nbsp; Who can whiten that which is already
white as snow?&nbsp; What can cleanse the garment that is already
washed in the Lamb&rsquo;s most precious blood?&nbsp; Who can
take away the curse which is already blotted out for ever?&nbsp;
What new atonement, what second sacrifice, what <a
name="page70"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 70</span>fresh victim,
can avail anything to the perfect acceptance of that
believer&rsquo;s soul who is already made the righteousness of
God in Christ?</p>
<p>No more then of the awful thought that, that piece of bread is
the very person of our reigning Lord!&nbsp; No more of the
tremendous principle that there can be a second sacrifice of the
sacred life of Jesus; a second propitiation for the sins which
the Son of God has borne!&nbsp; We will adore our blessed Saviour
himself, as he is now seated at the right hand of God.&nbsp; We
will adore him as our Advocate, adore him as our king, adore him
as our accepted substitute.&nbsp; We will trust him for his
grace, we will praise him for his glory; we will believe in the
perfection of his perfect and all sufficient-work.&nbsp; He has
taken the burden of every sin for which conscience ever can
condemn us.&nbsp; He has endured the curse of every transgression
of which Satan ever can accuse us.&nbsp; He has washed unto
spotless whiteness the most sin-stained garment of his most
sin-polluted child.&nbsp; So scorning the thought of any second
sacrifice, we will go direct to Christ himself; and there in
faith lie waiting before his footstool, feeding on his grace,
rejoicing in his love, triumphing in his power, till he come
again in glory and welcome to his kingdom the whole multitude of
his ransomed saints.&nbsp; Even so, come Lord Jesus!!&nbsp; Come
quickly.</p>

<span class="GutSmall">THE CHURCH IN THE LATTER DAYS.</span></h2>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">2 <span
class="smcap">Tim</span>. iii. 1.</p>
<p>This know also that in the last days perilous times shall
come.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is nearly 1800 years since our
blessed Lord declared to his Apostle, &ldquo;Behold I come
quickly.&rdquo;&nbsp; It, therefore, well becomes his children to
be watching the signs of his appearing, and to be studying with
intense interest the records which he has given for the guidance
and warning of his people.&nbsp; It is not presumption, but sober
faith, thus to inquire into God&rsquo;s prophetic word.&nbsp; The
Book of Revelations was written <a name="citation71a"></a><a
href="#footnote71a" class="citation">[71a]</a> &ldquo;to show
unto God&rsquo;s servants things which must shortly come to
pass;&rdquo; and our Lord himself has directed us to observe the
appointed signs, to compare and check them with advancing
history, and when we shall see all these things come to pass, to
know that the day is near, even at the doors. <a
name="citation71b"></a><a href="#footnote71b"
class="citation">[71b]</a></p>
<p>We purpose, then, to close our present course <a
name="page72"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 72</span>by carefully
examining into God&rsquo;s description of the state of the church
in the latter days.</p>
<p>We sometimes hear the expression of sanguine and happy hopes
that the Gospel will so prevail throughout the world as to leave
no place either for heresy in religion, or for viciousness in
life; that there will arrive a time before the coming of our
blessed Lord, when men will witness the fulfilment of the
prophecy &ldquo;that righteousness shall cover the earth as the
waters cover the sea.&rdquo;&nbsp; Yet the smallest glance at the
prophetic Scriptures is sufficient to show that there is no
warrant for such bright anticipations there.&nbsp; Again and
again does God declares that the days immediately proceeding
Christ&rsquo;s coming shall be days of especial darkness both to
the world and to the church.&nbsp; &ldquo;Upon the earth distress
of nations, with perplexity; the sea and the waves roaring;
men&rsquo;s hearts failing them for fear; and for looking after
those things which are coming on the earth: for the powers of
heaven shall be shaken.&nbsp; And then shall they see the Son of
Man coming in a cloud with power and great glory.&rdquo; <a
name="citation72"></a><a href="#footnote72"
class="citation">[72]</a></p>
<p>With this description the language of our text is in close and
complete accordance.&nbsp; &ldquo;This know also, that in the
last days perilous times shall come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Let us, then, endeavour to profit by the word of warning, and
examine</p>
<p>I.&nbsp; The perils of the latter days;</p>
<p>II.&nbsp; The character and security of the saints of God.</p>
<p>I.&nbsp; The perils of the latter days.</p>
<p><a name="page73"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
73</span>(1.)&nbsp; There will be perils from the world
without.&nbsp; We have already learned from the language of our
blessed Lord that there will be &ldquo;distress of nations with
perplexity, men&rsquo;s hearts failing them for fear, and for
looking after those things which are coming on the
earth.&rdquo;&nbsp; We are told in St. Mark <a
name="citation73"></a><a href="#footnote73"
class="citation">[73]</a> that there shall be &ldquo;wars and
rumours of wars,&rdquo; that &ldquo;nation shall rise against
nation, and kingdom against kingdom; and there shall be
earthquakes in divers places; and there shall be famines and
troubles; these are the beginning of sorrows.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is
of course impossible but that the people of God should be deeply
affected by this awful convulsion of the moral atmosphere of the
world.&nbsp; When there is a universal earthquake in society, all
must feel the shock; when the storm bursts around us, all must be
more or less affected by the crash.</p>
<p>(2.)&nbsp; We must, therefore, reckon this coming convulsion
of society as one of the leading causes of the peculiar perils of
the latter days.&nbsp; But there are plain intimations in the
Word of God that the chief source of peril is to be found within
the visible church itself.&nbsp; An enemy within the citadel is
always more dangerous than an enemy without; and such an enemy is
plainly predicted in the Bible.&nbsp; Our text describes not the
opposition of infidelity, but the corruption of Christianity; and
draws our thoughts not to the conflicting powers of the world,
but to the degenerate principles of the church.&nbsp; &ldquo;For
men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, <a
name="page74"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 74</span>proud,
blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy, without
natural affection, truce breakers, false accusers, incontinent,
fierce, despisers of those that are good, traitorous, heady,
high-minded, lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God, having a
form of godliness, but denying the power thereof.&rdquo;&nbsp;
There is nothing here of wars or rumours of wars, of the array of
earthly monarchs against the cross; the danger here predicted is
found within the body of professors, and consists in a wide
spread, deep-rooted apostacy from the faith.&nbsp; Nor does this
apostacy lead to the open and avowed rejection of the
Gospel.&nbsp; Would that it did!&nbsp; The apostate body retains
its visible profession, and parades its high-sounding name of
Christianity, for (verse 5) it has &ldquo;a form of
godliness,&rdquo; while it denies its power.&nbsp; Though
ignorant of the truth, these false professors do not professedly
reject it, for they are &ldquo;ever learning and never able to
come to a knowledge of the truth.&rdquo;&nbsp; Thus are they
reprobate concerning the faith.&nbsp; To be reprobate implies
appearance, pretension, profession.&nbsp; Tin is not reprobate
unless it be passed as silver, nor the infidel reprobate unless
he assume the name of Christianity.&nbsp; The reprobate persons,
therefore, described in our text must retain their place amongst
professors, they must have the form of godliness, the bright
appearance of some precious metal, yet when tested and tried by
the Word of God, must be found to be a base coinage, reprobate
concerning the faith.</p>
<p>From these remarks it must be plain to all that the peculiar
peril of the latter day consists in the <a
name="page75"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 75</span>corruption of
Christianity by a body of men who all the while retain its form;
of men who, with a high-sounding profession, resist the truth as
it is in Jesus.&nbsp; The same appears with no less distinctness
in 1 Tim. iv. 1&ndash;3, &ldquo;Now the Spirit speaketh expressly
that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith, giving
heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils; speaking lies
in hypocrisy; having their conscience seared with a hot iron;
forbidding to marry, and commanding to abstain from meats, which
God hath created to be received with thanksgiving of them which
believe and know the truth.&rdquo;&nbsp; There can be no doubt
that in both passages the Holy Spirit is warning us of the same
danger; for in both the leading features are the same.&nbsp; The
evil springs up not without the church to resist, but within the
church to corrupt it.&nbsp; The deadly plant has its root in the
garden of the Lord.&nbsp; &ldquo;Some shall <i>depart</i> from
the faith.&rdquo;&nbsp; There is no rejection of the visible
profession of the Gospel, for the description given applies not
to infidelity but to degeneracy; it is a departure from the
faith, not from the name of Christianity.&nbsp; &ldquo;Forbidding
to marry, and commanding to abstain from meats.&rdquo;&nbsp; So
the influence exerted is on Christian brethren, for they seek to
bind the yoke around the neck of those which &ldquo;believe and
know the truth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>These two passages are enough to show that the apostacy of
professors, and not the assault of infidels, is the great source
of peril in the latter days.&nbsp; But there is one further
passage which we <a name="page76"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
76</span>cannot pass unnoticed, namely, 2 Thess. ii. 3&ndash;11.
<a name="citation76a"></a><a href="#footnote76a"
class="citation">[76a]</a>&nbsp; In verse 3 we are plainly told
that before the day of Christ shall come there must be a falling
away, a revealing of the man of sin, the son of perdition.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Let no man deceive you by any means; for that day shall
not come, except there come a falling away first, and that man of
sin be revealed, the son of perdition.&rdquo;&nbsp; The connexion
of the passage with those just considered appears more distinctly
in the Greek than in the English, where the sentence
stands.&nbsp; &ldquo;Except there come <i>the</i> <a
name="citation76b"></a><a href="#footnote76b"
class="citation">[76b]</a> falling away,&rdquo; the expression
&ldquo;<i>the</i>&rdquo; connecting it plainly with the other
prophecies of the Bible, and the general expectation of the
Church.&nbsp; The connexion also with the <a
name="page77"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 77</span>latter days
of the world&rsquo;s history is proved distinctly by the fact
that the man of sin is to be destroyed by the brightness of our
Lord&rsquo;s return, &ldquo;whom the Lord shall consume with the
Spirit of his mouth and destroy with the brightness of his
coming.&rdquo;&nbsp; We may, therefore, regard this chapter as
giving an account of the same apostacy as that alluded to in the
other texts.&nbsp; And now mark its character.&nbsp; It springs
up in the church itself.&nbsp; Apostacy means departure or
decline, and therefore, as we remarked in the text from Timothy,
it is not an infidel power rising up against us to attack, but a
degenerate power growing up in the midst of us to corrupt.&nbsp;
As it springs up within the church so does it retain its place
there.&nbsp; &ldquo;It sits in the temple of God.&rdquo;&nbsp;
The church of God is often spoken of as a temple, as in 1 Cor.
iii. 16, &ldquo;Know ye not that ye are the temple of God?&rdquo;
<a name="citation77"></a><a href="#footnote77"
class="citation">[77]</a>&nbsp; And to sit in the temple of God
implies that it occupies the seat, retains the name, and assumes
the sanctity of the church of God.&nbsp; So again the words,
&ldquo;Sheweth himself that he is God,&rdquo; point not to the
infidel but to the professor, to one usurping, not attacking the
sovereignty of Jehovah.&nbsp; The man of sin does not deny
God&rsquo;s existence, but usurps God&rsquo;s authority.&nbsp;
But when thus seated in the temple of God he is guilty of most
awful sin.&nbsp; He sets himself above God; he displays himself
as though he were God; he &ldquo;shows himself that he is
God;&rdquo; he assumes God&rsquo;s attributes; he lays claim to
the powers and even titles of Jehovah.&nbsp; The elements of this
apostacy <a name="page78"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
78</span>were at work even in the days of the apostle.&nbsp; The
seed was even then sown, the deadly leaven was already fermenting
in the church.&nbsp; &ldquo;The mystery of iniquity doth already
work.&rdquo;&nbsp; The time, however, was not yet come for the
revealing or manifestation of his character and power.&nbsp;
There was a certain restraining force which then kept him
in.&nbsp; But this force was not to last for ever, for he
&ldquo;that letteth should be taken away, and then should that
wicked be revealed.&rdquo;&nbsp; This restraining force has
always been explained as that of the Roman empire.&nbsp; The
early church never questioned it, and it is a fact stated on good
authority, and worthy of the deepest consideration, that the
primitive Christians used to pray in their public worship for the
preservation of the empire of pagan Rome, because they were
persuaded from this prophecy, that when it fell the man of sin
should be established on its ruins.&nbsp; But there is one other
feature in this man of sin to be most carefully noted by the
church.&nbsp; It does not refer to any single individual, but to
a long series of apostate professors.&nbsp; It has been thought
by some that the man of sin will be some single individual; one
glance, however, at the passage will suffice to show that it must
refer to a long series of successors.&nbsp; The whole period
between the date of the epistle and the final coming of our
blessed Lord is divided in the prophecy between &ldquo;him that
letteth&rdquo; <a name="citation78"></a><a href="#footnote78"
class="citation">[78]</a> and &ldquo;the <a
name="page79"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 79</span>man of
sin.&rdquo;&nbsp; He that letteth then existed, and would
continue till the man of sin took his place.&nbsp; The man of sin
again would retain his place till the Lord Jesus appeared in
glory.&nbsp; The two together, therefore, occupy a period of
almost 1800 years.&nbsp; They cannot, therefore, both be
individuals.&nbsp; One at least must represent a series of
successors.&nbsp; But the two expressions are equally
personal.&nbsp; &ldquo;He that letteth&rdquo; (&#8001;
&kappa;&alpha;&tau;&#941;&chi;&omega;&nu;) is a form of
expression quite as personal as &ldquo;the man of
sin.&rdquo;&nbsp; It would be inconsistent therefore to say that
one represents a series, and the other an individual.&nbsp; They
must be both successions or both individuals.&nbsp; The latter
supposition we have already shown to be impossible, the former we
firmly believe to be the truth.</p>
<p>The apostacy, therefore, is not a sudden and passing outbreak
of corruption just in advance of the advent of our Lord, but a
deep-rooted, long-existing, departure from the faith, handed down
from age to age, and spreading its baneful influence from the
breaking up of the Roman empire <a name="page80"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 80</span>to its final destruction at the
coming of the Lord in glory.&nbsp; Now it is plain that the
existence of such a body must render the latter days indeed
perilous to the saints of God.&nbsp; It possesses every influence
of every worldly kind; the influence of secular power, rising up
as the successor to the empire of Rome; the authority of
ecclesiastical position, sitting in the temple of God; the
cunning of deep seductiveness, being itself the mystery of
iniquity; the association of long-continued influence, spreading
on from century to century; with the direct support of Satan
himself, &ldquo;for his coming is after the working of Satan with
all power and signs and lying wonders.&rdquo; <a
name="citation80"></a><a href="#footnote80"
class="citation">[80]</a>&nbsp; Such is the apostacy against
which the saints of God are called to take their stand, and with
reference to which it is predicted by the Spirit that &ldquo;in
the last days perilous times shall come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But where are we to look for this apostacy?&nbsp; It is
described in prophecy: can it be traced in history?&nbsp; It is
predicted in the word: can it be found in fact?&nbsp; Is the man
of sin yet seated in the temple of God?&nbsp; I should not be a
faithful servant of my God, if I did not express my deep
conviction that this most perilous apostacy is the Papal system
of the Church of Rome.&nbsp; For mark the close correspondence
between the words of the prophecy, and the facts of
history.&nbsp; The man of sin, according to the prophecy, was to
spring up in the bosom of the church itself.&nbsp; Who shall deny
that this is the case with the Romish popedom?&nbsp; <a
name="page81"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 81</span>The man of
sin was to sit in the temple of God.&nbsp; The Pope of Rome
declares himself that he sits as Christ&rsquo;s vicar in the
chair of Peter, and sways the sceptre of universal dominion in
the church.&nbsp; The man of sin represents a long succession,
maintaining the same principles, and heading the same apostacy
from the truth: the exact counterpart of the popes of Rome.</p>
<p>The history of the man of sin is marked by three important
dates.&nbsp; His principles were working secretly in the days of
the apostles.&nbsp; He would be revealed or made manifest at the
breaking up of the Roman empire.&nbsp; He would be destroyed at
the coming of our blessed Lord.&nbsp; The two first of these
dates exactly tally with the history of the Romish popedom.&nbsp;
From many passages in the Epistles it may be gathered that its
principles were working secretly when the apostles wrote them. <a
name="citation81"></a><a href="#footnote81"
class="citation">[81]</a>&nbsp; As the empire declined the Bishop
of Rome rose in power, till at length, when the Emperor was taken
out of the way, the Bishop stepped into his place, asserted
himself to be <a name="page82"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
82</span>Christ&rsquo;s vicar, and pronounced himself Lord of all
the authorities of the known world.&nbsp; The words therefore can
allude to no later heresy at some future time to arise within the
church, for the mystery was already working, and the public
development was to take place when the Roman empire was
destroyed.&nbsp; Of course the third date cannot yet be tried by
history.&nbsp; It may serve, however, to fix the prophecy on the
Church of Rome, for it proves that it can refer to none of the
early heresies in the church; they have long since vanished, and
cannot be destroyed by the brightness of Christ&rsquo;s
appearing.&nbsp; The history of the Church of Rome then exactly
tallies with the prophecy, and <i>nothing else can</i>.&nbsp; But
what shall we say of the awful assumption predicted of the man of
sin?&nbsp; Can that be charged on the Romish popedom?&nbsp; It
saith, &ldquo;Who opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is
called God or that is worshipped.&rdquo;&nbsp; With sorrow of
heart we are compelled to acknowledge that we fear it is one of
the marked features of his character.&nbsp; See how he has dared
to tamper with the commands of God himself.&nbsp; I have myself
seen a catechism, in which the second commandment is actually
struck out of the decalogue of God.&nbsp; Why is it, again, that
none of the laity in the Church of Rome receive the cup in the
Sacrament of the Lord&rsquo;s supper?&nbsp; Our Lord himself
plainly commanded it.&nbsp; He even made the command more
expressive for the cup than for the bread, saying, &ldquo;Drink
ye <i>all</i> of this;&rdquo; yet Rome says to all her laity,
&ldquo;Drink ye none of this.&rdquo;&nbsp; What is this but to
exalt himself <a name="page83"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
83</span>above the Saviour, and with a bold hand to set aside the
plain command of God himself?&nbsp; And look again at the
doctrine of transubstantiation.&nbsp; You will remember the
passages quoted last Sunday from the Councils.&nbsp; They taught
that the priest could make <a name="citation83"></a><a
href="#footnote83" class="citation">[83]</a> Christ the Son of
God, could shut him in a casket, could carry him in a procession,
could sacrifice him for sin.&nbsp; What is this but to exalt
himself above all that is called God or that is worshipped?&nbsp;
But the prophecy adds, &ldquo;Sitteth in the temple of God
shewing himself that he is God.&rdquo;&nbsp; This may refer to
the assumption either of God&rsquo;s attributes or titles.&nbsp;
The claim of infallibility, universal dominion, and the power of
absolute forgiveness is nothing less than a usurpation of the
attributes of God.&nbsp; But he has dared also to assume the
titles, yea the very title of God himself.&nbsp; When the Lateran
Council was held at Rome, and Pope Leo sat enthroned in the
Lateran church, which claimed to be the mother church of
universal Christendom, when he thus sat in the temple of God
surrounded by its assembled representatives, the public orator,
Marcellus, had the daring boldness to give utterance to the
words, &ldquo;Thou art our shepherd, our <a
name="page84"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 84</span>physician, in
short, a second God in the world.&rdquo; <a
name="citation84"></a><a href="#footnote84"
class="citation">[84]</a>&nbsp; &ldquo;Sitteth in the temple of
God, showing himself that he is God.&rdquo;&nbsp; Did ever
portrait more completely represent the person?</p>
<p>We conclude then that the Church of Rome is the great
apostacy, the peculiar danger which makes the latter days so
pre-eminently perilous.&nbsp; But we have not yet done with the
consideration of their danger, for we are taught,</p>
<p>(3)&nbsp; That there will be a peculiar power of seduction
immediately preceding the advent of our Lord.&nbsp; All the
prophecies to which we have to-day alluded agree in showing that
the great apostacy would be marked throughout its course by a
mysterious power of seducing souls.&nbsp; But there are plain
intimations in the word of God, that this power will be put forth
in the latter days with an energy both multiplied and
quickened.&nbsp; Nor is this a point of trivial importance; <a
name="page85"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 85</span>for you often
hear it urged that we are too enlightened in this nineteenth
century to be again ensnared by the superstitious principles of
Rome.&nbsp; The rapid progress of scientific knowledge is thought
a sufficient antidote against the seductions of those who would
pervert the truth.&nbsp; Now such opinions will not stand for a
moment the test of Scripture; for the Holy Ghost declares
expressly that at the very time when science shall have reached
its height, and when human intelligence shall have gained the
very climax of its perfection, (I mean at the time just preceding
the advent of our Lord,) that at that very crisis there shall be
an unparalleled spirit of delusion in vigorous activity
throughout the Church.&nbsp; Our Lord himself has prepared us for
such a fact. <a name="citation85"></a><a href="#footnote85"
class="citation">[85]</a>&nbsp; &ldquo;For there shall arise
false Christs and false prophets, and shall shew great signs and
wonders; insomuch that if it were possible they shall deceive the
very elect.&rdquo;&nbsp; And the Spirit of God has expressly
revealed it in Rev. xvi. 13&ndash;15.&nbsp; &ldquo;And I saw
three unclean spirits like frogs, come out of the mouth of the
dragon, and out of the mouth of the beast, and out of the mouth
of the false prophet.&nbsp; For they are the spirits of devils,
working miracles, which go forth unto the kings of the earth, and
the whole world, to gather them to the battle of that great day
of God Almighty.&nbsp; Behold I come as a thief.&nbsp; Blessed is
he that watcheth, and keepeth his garments lest he walk naked,
and they see his <a name="page86"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
86</span>shame.&rdquo;&nbsp; I cannot now attempt a comment on
these remarkable words, but only just observe two things
respecting them.</p>
<p>(1)&nbsp; They allude to a period closely preceding the
winding up of the world&rsquo;s history: there are seven vials,
and these spirits appear under the sixth; when the seventh is
poured out, the words are uttered, &ldquo;It is done.&rdquo; <a
name="citation86a"></a><a href="#footnote86a"
class="citation">[86a]</a></p>
<p>(2)&nbsp; They represent this period as a time of peculiar
delusion throughout the world.&nbsp; The other vials all speak of
war, suffering, and bloodshed: under the sixth there is a hush,
like the hush of peace; its leading feature is delusion; delusion
varied in all its forms, for there are three spirits; devilish in
its origin, for they are the spirits of devils; prevailing in its
influence, for it will throw its seductive power over the rulers
of the world, and so sway the minds of states, that they will be,
as it were, spell-bound, and lend their influence to the direct
support of the antagonist of God.&nbsp; &ldquo;They go forth to
the kings of the earth, and of the whole world, and gather them
to the battle of that great day of God Almighty.&rdquo; <a
name="citation86b"></a><a href="#footnote86b"
class="citation">[86b]</a>&nbsp; I am not now intending to occupy
your time by comparing this prophecy with history; my object is
to bring home to each of you the fact, the one simple and most
startling fact, that a spirit of strong delusion will <a
name="page87"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 87</span>peculiarly
mark the latter days.&nbsp; The church is not to sit still in
calm security, as though her warfare were accomplished, and her
crown won at the Reformation.&nbsp; The great struggle is to be
at last, the unclean spirits are to come forth at last; the
sifting and searching days are to be at last.&nbsp; The nearer we
approach to the advent, the greater the need of watchfulness; the
farther the world advances, the more cautious heed should we pay
to the warning voice of our Saviour; &ldquo;Behold, I come as a
thief.&nbsp; Blessed is he that watcheth and keepeth his
garments, lest he walk naked, and they see his shame.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There is, therefore, abundant reason to believe that in the
last days perilous times shall occur, it behoves us then to look
most carefully into the second division of our subject.</p>
<p>II.&nbsp; The character and security of the people of God.</p>
<p>Nor is it enough for us to rest in any general description, as
for example, in the fact that they are called, sealed, written in
the book of life; we want such a description of their character
as shall place them in contrast with the apostacy of the age in
which they live.&nbsp; Such a description we may reasonably look
for in the book of Revelation.&nbsp; The fullest account is there
given of the apostacy; so there we should look for the clearest
description of the contrasted saints.&nbsp; Now there is one
sentence in that sacred book, which may supply us with the exact
description we require, and which appears to point to two leading
signs as distinguishing the character of the saints of God, viz.
their submission to the <a name="page88"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 88</span>word of God, and their simple faith
in Christ himself.&nbsp; I allude to the language of the Holy
Ghost in Rev. xiv. 12.&nbsp; &ldquo;Here is the patience of the
saints: here are they that keep the commandments of God, and the
faith of Jesus.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nor is this a single, solitary passage.&nbsp; It seems to form
as it were the motto of the whole book of the Apocalypse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who bare record of the word of God, and of the
testimony of Jesus Christ.&rdquo; Rev. i. 2.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I, John, was in the isle that is called Patmos, for the
word of God, and for the testimony of Jesus Christ.&rdquo; Rev.
i. 9.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I saw under the altar the souls of them that were slain
for the word of God, and for the testimony which they
held.&rdquo; Rev. vi. 9.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb, and by
the word of their testimony.&rdquo; Rev. xii. 12.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the dragon was wroth with the woman, and went to
make war with the remnant of her seed, which keep the
commandments of God, and have the testimony of Jesus
Christ.&rdquo; Rev. xii. 17.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I saw the souls of them that were beheaded for the
witness of Jesus, and for the word of God.&rdquo; Rev. xx. 4.</p>
<p>In these words we have the saints of God again and again
placed in direct contrast with the apostacy; we may therefore
boldly refer to them as marking distinctly their character.</p>
<p>(1)&nbsp; What then is this character?&nbsp; They are
witnesses.</p>
<p>They are not carried away by the prevailing <a
name="page89"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 89</span>apostacy of
the times, but are witnesses against surrounding error.&nbsp; The
expression &ldquo;witness&rdquo; implies that they stand aloof as
a protesting body.&nbsp; The witness for God is not one who
floats down the broad tide of popular opinion, but who stands up
in opposition to it, and boldly proclaims the truth of God.&nbsp;
Athanasius was a witness for Christ, when he stood forth with all
the world against him, and himself alone contending against the
world.&nbsp; Our Saviour was a witness to the truth, when before
Pontius Pilate he witnessed a good confession, and was bold to
endure the cross in order to fulfil the Father&rsquo;s
will.&nbsp; Thus the Greek word for &ldquo;witnesses&rdquo; is
the same as that for &ldquo;martyrs,&rdquo; <a
name="citation89a"></a><a href="#footnote89a"
class="citation">[89a]</a> and the witness for Christ must be one
raising the voice of protest, and contending against opposition
for the truth once delivered to the Saints.</p>
<p>But for what are they witnesses?&nbsp; &ldquo;For Jesus and
the word of God.&rdquo; <a name="citation89b"></a><a
href="#footnote89b" class="citation">[89b]</a></p>
<p>These two subjects form the great matter of their
protest.&nbsp; &ldquo;They keep the commandments of God and the
faith of Jesus.&rdquo;&nbsp; They are not occupied by secondary
matters, nor debating on ecclesiastical distinctions.&nbsp; Such
questions would not justify their separation.&nbsp; The word of
God and the Son of God are the grand points for which they
struggle.</p>
<p>Now this, let it be well observed, is the exact position of
the faithful Protestant.&nbsp; As witnesses we are forced into
separation from the great mass of professing Christendom.&nbsp;
We were <a name="page90"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
90</span>compelled at the Reformation either to abandon truth, or
to quit the church which claims to itself the name of
Catholic.&nbsp; And what is the subject matter of our
protest?&nbsp; What are the points for which we struggle?&nbsp;
If we were to search throughout the English language for any one
short sentence, which should contain at once the sum and
substance of our Protestant profession, I know of none that could
be so exactly suitable as that with which the Holy Ghost has
furnished us,&mdash;&ldquo;the witness of Jesus and the Word of
God.&rdquo;&nbsp; The whole of the Protestant controversy
branches out from this one passage: it contains the germ of the
whole argument.</p>
<p>Now there is something very cheering in this conclusion.&nbsp;
We are often taunted with our disunion from the (so called)
Catholic church: we are often reproached because we are in a
state of separation.&nbsp; But we give thanks for those
reproaches.&nbsp; They are amongst the title-deeds of our
inheritance; they help to prove us what we wish to be, the saints
of God, and the witnesses for Christ.&nbsp; Had the Spirit of God
described the saints in the latter days, as united under one
vicar upon earth, as swaying the sceptre of unresisted power, as
exercising lordship over kings and potentates, as reigning
triumphantly through the known world, then indeed we should have
trembled.&nbsp; But now it is the reverse.&nbsp; Our position is
exactly that ascribed to the saints of God in prophecy; the
position of Rome exactly that ascribed to the man of sin.&nbsp;
The Scriptures tell us plainly that the saints in the <a
name="page91"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 91</span>latter days
must stand aloof from the great apostacy, raising against it the
voice of protest; and it fills our heart with gladness to find
ourselves in that exact position.&nbsp; The saints of God are
described in prophecy almost by the very name of
&ldquo;Protestant.&rdquo;&nbsp; We are not ashamed, therefore, of
the blessed title, but following the guidance of the prophetic
Scriptures, we had rather far be called &ldquo;Protestant&rdquo;
than &ldquo;Catholic.&rdquo;&nbsp; He that sits in the temple of
God, showing himself that he is God, he is sure to claim for
himself the name of Catholic, but he that is the servant of God
must stand out boldly as the unflinching Protestant for
Christ.</p>
<p>(2)&nbsp; This also is the security of the saints.</p>
<p>To stand against the apostacy of the latter days, they must be
drawing truth from God himself, and deriving life from Christ
himself.&nbsp; They must listen to God himself, as speaking to
them in his own inspired word, they must be kept by Christ
himself while they believe on him as their only Lord.&nbsp; Their
strength lies in this, that there is no curtain, no veil, no
cloud between the soul and God&mdash;no second Mediator to convey
the truth to them, or to convey them to Christ.&nbsp; They go
straight into the presence of the Father: they learn his own word
from his own lips, and they are ushered into his presence by his
own well-beloved Son.&nbsp; So it is that they &ldquo;overcome by
the blood of the Lamb, and by the word of their
testimony.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This is their safety against error.&nbsp; In the doubts, and
dangers, and delusions of the latter <a name="page92"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 92</span>days, they rest on that which is
infallible.&nbsp; Holy writers may mislead; human guides may
fail; the most attractive ministers may become spellbound by the
seductions of the day; but the Word of God remains unaltered and
unalterable; and the saints of God must stand secure, being
taught by the Spirit to depend on it alone for truth.</p>
<p>This is their security against a fall.&nbsp; They bear their
testimony to the glories of Christ&rsquo;s grace, and meanwhile
they rest secure in it.&nbsp; As witnesses for Christ, they are
believers in Christ.&nbsp; The foundation on which they build is
Christ himself.&nbsp; They lean on his atonement, his
all-sufficient sacrifice, his perfect and complete redemption,
nor can all the storms of hell prevail to shake their
safety.&nbsp; The anchor of their soul entereth into that within
the veil; and though they may here be tossed and troubled, no
trouble, no turmoil, no distraction can tear them from the anchor
that is fixed fast in the sanctuary of God.&nbsp; They derive
their strength from Christ himself, as seated at the right hand
of God; they live with him in the enjoyment of a direct and
immediate union with himself; &ldquo;Their life is hid with
Christ in God:&rdquo; and no man can rend the bond; no
distractions can burst the union; nor can all the devils in hell
combined prevail to pluck one single saint out of the faithful
hand of his redeeming Lord.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am persuaded that
neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor
powers, nor things present, nor things to come, nor height, nor
depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from
the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page93"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 93</span>And
now, dear brethren, to conclude.&nbsp; I have preached these
sermons under the deep conviction that clouds are gathering
around us, and that our great sifting time is near.&nbsp;
Eighteen hundred years have nearly passed since the Saviour said,
&ldquo;I come quickly.&rdquo;&nbsp; Nor are there signs wanting
of his approach.&nbsp; There is to be seen throughout the world a
breaking down of fixed principles of religious belief, a spirit
of un-settlement brooding over the minds of men, and a loose
indifference to the unscriptural claims of Rome.&nbsp; All this
is predicted as a sign of his approach.&nbsp; Let us then stand
fast in Jesus Christ, and Jesus Christ alone.&nbsp; As pardoned
sinners, let us cling to the cross; as justified believers, let
us go boldly to the throne of grace; as God&rsquo;s elect, let us
rally round the banner of the Lamb.&nbsp; Then men of expediency
may forsake the truth in the hour of its need; men ignorant of
their bibles may be carried off by the seducing spirits of the
latter days: men of unbelief may scoff alike at our fears and
hopes; but Christ will hold us fast in his own right hand till
the day of his coming.&nbsp; Clouds may gather, black as hell;
storms may burst, terrific in their crash; but we shall be kept
safe in the pavilion of our God, till we join the one, vast,
harmonious hymn of praise, which will swell up from the whole
company of God&rsquo;s elect, to welcome Christ as he comes forth
in his kingdom, the Redeemer, the Advocate, the Strength, the
Salvation of his saints.</p>

94</span>APPENDIX.</h2>
<h3>A.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> 4th Rule of the Council of
Trent respecting Prohibited Books:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Since it has been found by experience that if the
Sacred Scriptures are allowed everywhere without distinction in
the vulgar tongue, more harm than good arises in consequence of
the rashness of man; let this be left to the judgment of the
Bishop or Inquisitor; so that with the advice of the parish
priest or confessor he may allow the use of the Bible in the
vulgar tongue, when translated by Catholic authors, to such
persons as they may consider capable of receiving not injury, but
an increase of their faith and piety, from this kind of reading:
which permission they must receive in writing.&nbsp; But any one
who shall presume without such permission either to read or to
possess them, shall be forbidden the absolution of his sins,
unless he first restore the Bible to the ordinary.&nbsp;
Booksellers also, who shall sell the Bible in the vulgar tongue
to any <a name="page95"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 95</span>one
without the aforesaid permission, or shall in any other way
provide it, shall forfeit the price of the books, to be employed
in pious uses by the Bishop, and shall be subject to such other
penalties as the Bishop may think it right to inflict, according
to the character of the offence.&nbsp; Regulars may neither read
nor purchase them without receiving permission from their
prelates.&rdquo;</p>
<p>N.B.&mdash;It is very important to observe that this rule
refers to Roman Catholic versions, i.e., to their own authorized
translations, and forbids even the regulars to possess a copy
without permission from the Bishop.</p>
<h3>B.</h3>
<p>The following extracts from the letter of the present Pope,
dated 8th of May, 1844, show that the decree of the Council of
Trent is still in full force with reference to the circulation of
the Scriptures:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To return to Bibles translated into the vulgar
tongue.&nbsp; It is long since pastors found themselves
necessitated to turn their attention particularly to the versions
current at secret conventicles, and which heretics laboured, at
great expense, to disseminate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hence the warning and decrees of our predecessor,
Innocent III., of happy memory, on the subject of lay societies
and meetings of women, who had assembled themselves in the <a
name="page96"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 96</span>diocese of
Metz, for objects of piety and the study of the Holy
Scriptures.&nbsp; Hence the prohibition which subsequently
appeared in France and Spain during the sixteenth century, with
respect to the vulgar Bible.&nbsp; It became necessary,
subsequently, to take even greater precautions, when the
pretended Reformers, Luther and Calvin, daring by a multiplicity
and incredible variety of errors, to attack the immutable
doctrine of the faith, omitted nothing in order to seduce the
faithful by their false interpretations, and translations into
their vernacular tongues, which the then novel invention of
printing contributed more rapidly to propagate and
multiply.&nbsp; Whence it was generally laid down in the
regulations dictated by the Fathers, adopted by the Council of
Trent, and approved of by our predecessor, Pius VII., of happy
memory, and which regulations are prefixed to the list of
prohibited books, that the reading of the holy Bible translated
into the vulgar tongue, should not be permitted except to those
to whom it might be deemed necessary to confirm in the faith and
piety.&nbsp; Subsequently, when heretics still persisted in their
frauds, it became necessary for Benedict XIV. to superadd <a
name="citation96"></a><a href="#footnote96"
class="citation">[96]</a> the injunction that no versions
whatever should be suffered to be read but those which should be
approved of by the Holy See, accompanied by notes derived from
the writings of the holy Fathers, or other <a
name="page97"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 97</span>learned and
Catholic authors.&nbsp; Notwithstanding this, some new sectarians
of the school of Jansenius, after the example of the Lutherans
and Calvinists, feared not to blame these justifiable precautions
of the Apostolical See, as if the reading of the holy books had
been at all times, and for all the faithful, useful, and so
indispensable that no authority could assail it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we find this audacious assertion of Jansenius,
withered by the most rigorous censures in the solemn sentence,
which was pronounced against their doctrine, with the assent of
the whole Catholic universe, by the sovereign pontiffs of modern
times, Clement XI. in his <i>unigenitus</i> constitution of the
year 1713, and Pius VI. in his constitution <i>auctorem fidei</i>
of the year 1794.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Consequently, even before the establishment of Bible
Societies was thought of, the decrees of the Church which we have
quoted, were intended to guard the faithful against the frauds of
heretics, who cloak themselves under the specious pretext that it
is necessary to propagate and render common the study of the holy
books.&nbsp; Since then, our predecessor, Pius VII. of glorious
memory, observing the machinations of these societies to increase
under his pontificate, did not cease to oppose their efforts, at
one time through the medium of the apostolical nuncios, at
another by letters and decrees, emanating from the several
congregations of cardinals of the holy Church, and at another by
the two pontifical letters addressed to the Bishops of Gnesen and
the Archbishop of Mohilif.&nbsp; After him, another of our holy
predecessors, Leo XII., reproved <a name="page98"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 98</span>the operations of the Bible
Societies, by his circulars addressed to all the Catholic pastors
in the universe, under the date of May 5th, 1824.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shortly afterwards, our immediate predecessor, Pius
VIII. of happy memory, confirmed their condemnation by his
circular letter of May 24, 1829.&nbsp; We, in short, who
succeeded them, notwithstanding our great unworthiness, have not
ceased to be solicitous on this subject, and have especially
studied to bring to the recollection of the faithful, the several
rules which have been successively laid down with regard to the
vulgar versions of the holy books.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let all know then the enormity of the sin against God
and the church which they are guilty of, who dare to associate
themselves with any of these (the bible) societies, or abet them
in any way.&nbsp; Moreover, we confirm and renew the decrees
recited above, delivered in former times by apostolic authority
against the publication, distribution, reading, and possession of
books of the Holy Scriptures translated into the vulgar
tongue.&nbsp; With reference to the works of whatsoever writer we
call to mind, the observance of the general rules and decrees of
our predecessors, to be found prefixed to the <i>index</i> of
prohibited books: and we invite the faithful to be upon their
guard, not only against the books named in the <i>index</i>, but
also against those prescribed in the general
prescriptions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>These extracts prove beyond the possibility of controversy</p>
<p>(1.)&nbsp; That the rule of the Index of the Council <a
name="page99"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 99</span>of Trent has
never been permitted to fall into abeyance, and has never been
repealed.&nbsp; From the time of its enactment it has always
been, and now is, the binding law of the Church of Rome.&nbsp; It
has been constantly enforced by Papal authority, and is
especially commended to the careful attention of the faithful by
the authoritative letter of the present Pope.</p>
<p>(2.)&nbsp; That no Roman Catholic is permitted on any pretext
to read, or to possess a copy of the Bible in his own language,
without a written order from the Bishop or Inquisitor.&nbsp; It
matters not who is the author of the translation, whether
Protestant or Romanist, whether Luther or the Pope himself; if
any man either possess or read it, for that offence he is cut off
from absolution and thereby from church communion.</p>
<p>(3.)&nbsp; That since the days of Benedict XIV. it has always
been, and now is, unlawful under any circumstances to read any
version without notes.&nbsp; God&rsquo;s word is not allowed to
speak for itself; man&rsquo;s gloss must accompany it; the truth
is forbidden in its simplicity; they are afraid to allow the
people to read even their own version, without superadding
extracts from &ldquo;other learned and Catholic
authors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>(4.)&nbsp; That these versions with their notes may not be
possessed or read unless they are first approved of by the Holy
See.&nbsp; Query.&nbsp; How many versions approved by the Pope
exist in the whole world?&nbsp; Is there one in England?&nbsp; It
is of course difficult to prove a negative; but those who are
best acquainted with the subject assert that they <a
name="page100"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 100</span>have never
been able to discover one.&nbsp; See Venn&rsquo;s Letter to
Waterworth, Jan. 15, 1845.</p>
<p>(5.)&nbsp; That the Church of Rome attacks the broad principle
of the general usefulness of the Bible.&nbsp; The Pope does not
merely discuss the comparative merits of this or that version,
but goes boldly to the great question, whether the reading of the
Bible is really useful for the people.&nbsp; The Jansenists,
according to his own account, asserted that the reading of the
holy books &ldquo;had been at all times, and for all the
faithful, useful, and so indispensable that no authority could
assail it.&rdquo;&nbsp; This he declares to be an audacious
assertion, and pronounces it withered by the unanimous
condemnation of the whole Catholic universe.</p>

class="footnote">[13b]</a>&nbsp; In the letter itself, Leo says,
&ldquo;Reprove . . . that the faithful entrusted to you,
(adhering strictly to the rules of our congregation of the
Index,) be persuaded that if the Sacred Scriptures be everywhere
indiscriminately published, more evil than advantage will arise
thence, on account of the rashness of men.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
congregation of the Index, is a congregation appointed by the
Church of Rome to draw up a list of prohibited books.&nbsp; In
the 4th rule they condemn the free circulation of the
Bible.&nbsp; See Appendix A.</p>
<p>It should be observed that these extracts refer not to
Protestant, but to their own Roman Catholic versions.&nbsp; See
Mr. Venn&rsquo;s letter to Mr. Waterworth, January 15th,
1845.</p>
<p>The present Pope agrees with his predecessors.&nbsp; In the
letter above referred to, dated May the 8th, 1844, he says,
&ldquo;We confirm and renew the decrees recited above, delivered
in former times, by apostolic authority, against the publication,
distribution, reading, and possession of books of the Holy
Scripture translated into the vulgar tongue.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
motive for these restrictions appears very plainly from another
passage in the same letter.&nbsp; &ldquo;Watch attentively over
those who are appointed to expound the Holy Scriptures, and see
that they acquit themselves faithfully according to the capacity
of their hearers, and that they dare not under any pretext
whatever, interpret or explain the holy pages contrary to the
tradition of the holy fathers, and to the service of the Catholic
church.&rdquo;&nbsp; Here are two standards of interpretation
laid down, tradition, and self-interest.&nbsp; The Romish
Preacher must not preach even God&rsquo;s truth, if it does not
happen to serve the purposes of Rome.&nbsp; It seems very strange
that an infallible church should be so afraid of the infallible
word.&nbsp; Appendix B.</p>

worse still.&nbsp; According to it some men do more than is
required, and not only satisfy God&rsquo;s law themselves, but
gain a superfluous merit which may be made over to their less
perfect brethren.&nbsp; Catechism of the Council of Trent, Part
II., De P&aelig;nitentia, 109, 110, &ldquo;The extreme goodness
and clemency of God must be chiefly praised for this, that he has
granted to human weakness that one shall be allowed to make
satisfaction for another, which indeed belongs especially to this
part of penitence, for as with reference to contrition and
confession no man can mourn or confess for another, so those who
are indued with divine grace can perform in the name of another
that which is due to God.&nbsp; Whence it happens that in one
sense one man is found to bear another&rsquo;s burden.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I never could understand how the Church of Rome reconciles
this decree with its doctrine of extreme unction.&nbsp; The
Council of Trent decrees, Sess. xiv., Extreme Unction, Chap. 2,
&ldquo;The matter of the Sacrament is the grace of the Holy
Spirit, whose unction blots out all such offences, and remains of
sin, as still require expiation.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Cujus unctio
delicta, si qu&aelig; sint adhuc expianda, ac peccati reliquias
abstergit.&rdquo;&nbsp; If this be true, what sins remain for
expiation in purgatory?&nbsp; What can be the use of masses for
the dead?&nbsp; Surely the priests of the Church of Rome cannot
believe their own decree; for if they did, it would be nothing
short of robbery to receive fees for extricating souls from
purgatory.&nbsp; They are already free through extreme
unction.</p>
<p><a name="footnote49"></a><a href="#citation49"
class="footnote">[49]</a>&nbsp; How miserable is the confidence
of a poor dying Roman Catholic!&nbsp; He trembles at the thought
of purgatorial fire, and leaves money to the priest that masses
may be said for his release.&nbsp; If the priest happen to forget
him, in purgatory he must remain.&nbsp; Nay, more!&nbsp; If the
masses are offered they may be worthless, for the Church of Rome
declares the intention of the priest to be necessary to a
sacrament.&nbsp; Trent, Sess. vii., Can. 11.&nbsp; &ldquo;If any
man shall say that the intention of doing that which the church
does is not required in ministers while they perform and confer
the sacrament, let him be accursed.&rdquo;&nbsp; The priest,
therefore, may perform all the masses, and get all the money, and
yet if his intention happen to be wanting the poor soul would
profit nothing.&nbsp; This places the soul in purgatory at the
absolute mercy of the priest on earth.&nbsp; The Rev. James Page,
in his &ldquo;Letters to a Priest of the Church of Rome,&rdquo;
gives the following passage from the &ldquo;Master Key of
Popery,&rdquo; written by D. Antonio Gavin, in which he, who was
himself a priest, gives an extract from the private confession of
a priest, being at the point of death, in 1710.&nbsp; &ldquo;The
necessary intention of a priest, in the administration of baptism
and consecration, without which the sacraments are of none
effect, I confess I had it not several times, as you shall see in
the parish books; and observe there, that all those marked with a
star, the baptism was not valid, for I had no intention; and for
this I can give no other reason than my malice and wickedness;
many of them are dead, for which I am heartily sorry.&nbsp; As
for the times I have consecrated without intention, we must leave
it to God Almighty&rsquo;s mercy for the wrong done by it to the
souls of my parishioners, and those in purgatory cannot be
helped.&rdquo;&nbsp; Oh! that we could persuade our poor Roman
Catholic brethren to trust at once to the great High Priest, who
blotteth out all sin by his own most precious blood!</p>

<p><a name="footnote61"></a><a href="#citation61"
class="footnote">[61]</a>&nbsp; The words would not prove the
doctrine of the Church of Rome, even if the soul and divinity
were not added as they are.&nbsp; The utmost that could possibly
be proved from them is, that the bread was his body, and the wine
his blood.&nbsp; There is not a hint at the doctrine that the
wafer <i>alone</i> is a whole Christ, including both body and
blood.&nbsp; Indeed the addition of the words &ldquo;This is my
blood,&rdquo; distinctly proves the contrary, it shows that both
were not united in one.&nbsp; To avoid this obvious conclusion
is, I suspect, the reason why the cup is withheld from the
laity.</p>
<p><a name="footnote62"></a><a href="#citation62"
class="footnote">[62]</a>&nbsp; The Council of Trent appears
conscious of this absence of all scriptural authority, for in its
decree respecting the adoration of the wafer it appeals to
tradition only.&nbsp; &ldquo;Pro more in Catholica ecclesia
semper recepto.&rdquo;&nbsp; Sess. xiii. 5.</p>
<p><a name="footnote63"></a><a href="#citation63"
class="footnote">[63]</a>&nbsp; If the intention of the Priest be
wanting, then, according to the principles of the Church of Rome,
all the worshippers of the Host must be idolaters, for according
to their own Canon, (See page <span class="indexpageno"><a
href="#page49">49</a></span>,) without his secret intention no
change takes place.&nbsp; In such cases, therefore, the bread
remains bread, according to their own doctrine; and to worship it
with latria (the honour due to God) is manifest idolatry.</p>

of intention (page <span class="indexpageno"><a

priest think proper to withhold his intention, then the wafer
remains a wafer, and no change takes place.&nbsp; If the priest
think fit to will it, then the wafer is the very person, body,
nerves, soul, and divinity, of our living and reigning
Lord.&nbsp; The creation of the Saviour is therefore made
dependent upon the uncontrolled will of the priest.&nbsp; What is
this but to exalt himself above all that is called God or that is

acts of the Council were afterwards published by papal
authority.&nbsp; At the inauguration of the Pope he sits upon the
high altar in St. Peter&rsquo;s church, making the table of the
Lord his footstool, and in that position receives adoration from
the people.&nbsp; The following language was addressed to him in

another God upon earth; king of kings, and lord of lords.&nbsp;
The same is the dominion of God and the Pope.&nbsp; To believe
that our Lord God the Pope might not decree, as he has decreed,
were a matter of heresy.&nbsp; The power of the Pope is greater
than all created power, and extends itself to things celestial,

contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
